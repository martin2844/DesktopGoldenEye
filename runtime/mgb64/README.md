MGB64 ships as a real app: a Dear&nbsp;ImGui launcher rendered *in-process* —
insert a ROM, configure everything, jump to any level, and play, with an
in-game overlay (**F1**) for live settings. One portable codebase builds it on
all three desktop platforms.

| Platform | Download | Notes |

How it all works and how each platform is built:
**[docs/APP_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/APP_ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## What is this?

MGB64 combines the decompiled game code with a native PC/macOS port. It builds
on the same N64 decompilation ecosystem as
[Super Mario 64](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64) and
[Ocarina of Time](https://github.com/zeldaret/oot) decompilations and the
[Perfect Dark](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark) port:

- **A decompilation** — the original N64 game's logic, rewritten as readable,
  buildable C and MIPS assembly. The native port is the supported build today;
  byte-identical N64 ROM rebuilding is still in progress.
- **A native port** — a platform layer (`src/platform/`) that runs the same game
  code on PC/macOS: it loads *your* ROM at runtime, translates the N64 display
  lists to a modern GPU, and provides audio, input, and file I/O. No copyrighted
  data is compiled into the binary ("bring your own ROM").

## Status

> **Experimental.** This is a research/preservation project, not a polished
> consumer release, and it is **not** a 1:1 replacement for original hardware.

- ✅ The decompilation covers the bulk of the game's systems (rendering, AI,
  combat, level logic, menus, audio).
- ✅ **The native port builds and runs from a clean checkout + your own ROM**
  (`cmake -B build && cmake --build build`), with native rendering, audio, and
  keyboard/mouse + gamepad input.
- ✅ **Asset-free:** no ROM media is compiled into the binary — textures, audio,
  animation, fonts, and logos are read from *your* ROM at runtime.
- ✅ **Opt-in visual remaster:** a one-flag `--remaster` mode layers modern
  post-processing (ambient occlusion, bloom, filmic tonemap, colour grade, FXAA,
  supersampling) and optional user-built HD texture packs on a native Metal
  backend, while `--faithful` preserves the byte-faithful 1997 look. See
  **[docs/VISUAL_MODES.md](docs/VISUAL_MODES.md)**.
- ⚠️ **Platform support: developed and tested on macOS (Apple Silicon) only.**
  Windows and Linux have CMake/build-system support and are intended targets,
  but they have **not** been tested by the maintainers yet — expect build or
  runtime issues, and please report them (see
  [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md#reporting-platform-validation) for the
  platform validation report template).
- 🚧 Rebuilding the original **N64 ROM** (byte-matching), SDK provenance cleanup,
  and renderer/audio parity are the main open areas. See
  **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** for the
  precise state and good first issues.
- ⚠️ The tree still contains inventoried N64 SDK/libultra compatibility
  material that is **not** MIT-licensed first-party code. See
  **[THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md)** before describing or redistributing the
  project.

There are known graphical and gameplay issues and occasional instability. Bug
reports and PRs are very welcome.

## The app (insert ROM, configure, play)

Beyond the CLI, MGB64 builds an in-process **app** (default `-DMGB64_APP=ON`):
a Dear ImGui launcher rendered in the same window as the game — **no separate
process, one portable codebase** for macOS/Windows/Linux. It provides a native
"insert ROM" picker with validation, an auto-generated settings panel (every
engine config key), quick launch-to-level / multiplayer, and an in-game overlay
(F1) with live settings. Automation/diagnostic invocations bypass the launcher
and run the unchanged engine path, so the validation harness is unaffected.

- Run the launcher: `./build/ge007` (no arguments).
- macOS bundle: `./macos/Scripts/build_gl_app.sh` → `build-macos-app/MGB64.app`.
- Architecture + per-OS build/seams: **[docs/APP_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/APP_ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

> macOS is validated; Windows/Linux use only portable seams and are wired into the
> build and release pipeline. Prebuilt downloads (rolling `latest` + tagged
> releases) are attached to releases — see the **[Download](#download)** section above.

## Building

> [!WARNING]
> **This port has only been built and tested on macOS (Apple Silicon) so far.**
> The Linux and Windows (MSYS2/MinGW64) paths below are provided in good faith
> but are **not yet verified** by the maintainers. If they fail for you, please
> open a platform validation report issue.

Full instructions — toolchain, dependencies, native-port setup, and the
matching-target asset-extraction path — are in
**[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md)**. In brief:

1. Install the build dependencies for your platform (see the build doc).
2. Build the native port with CMake; the public checkout compiles without ROM
   media or extracted assets.
3. Run the port with a ROM **you legally own** using `--rom /path/to/rom.z64`,
   or place it at the repository root for auto-detection.
4. Matching-target contributors can use the asset-extraction and
   Makefile path described in the build docs.

```sh
# Native port (PC/macOS):
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

## Running

You must already own and supply the ROM — the port reads it at runtime; no game
data is bundled. The default command boots normally into the game frontend:

```sh
./build/ge007 --rom "/path/to/baserom.u.z64"
```

Common startup examples:

```sh
# Boot normally with an explicit ROM path:
./build/ge007 --rom "/path/to/baserom.u.z64"

# Direct-boot a solo stage by name:
./build/ge007 --rom "/path/to/baserom.u.z64" --level dam

# Direct-boot mission 2 on Secret Agent:
./build/ge007 --rom "/path/to/baserom.u.z64" --mission 2 --difficulty secret

# Direct-boot by raw internal LEVELID, useful for validation:
./build/ge007 --rom "/path/to/baserom.u.z64" --level 33

# Keep saves/config in a dedicated directory:
./build/ge007 --rom "/path/to/baserom.u.z64" --savedir "$HOME/.mgb64"
```

If you don't pass `--rom`, the port auto-detects a compatible ROM in the working
directory and common locations (`~/Downloads`, `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop`, `~`)
by size, N64 header, and internal cartridge name.

### Visual modes

The port renders a **faithful original** look and an opt-in **remaster**, each a
single flag. Note the default boot (no flag) already enables the cinematic post-FX
and 2× supersampling — so pass **`--faithful`** for the byte-faithful 1997 look.

| Mode | Command | What you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Faithful** | `./build/ge007 --faithful --level dam` | Byte-faithful 1997 original — post-FX off, native resolution, stock textures, classic FOV/crosshair/aim. |
| **Faithful HD** | `./build/ge007 --faithful-hd --level dam` | The faithful look at 2× supersampling and HD-pack-ready — set `Video.TexturePack` for HD textures. |
| **Default** | `./build/ge007 --level dam` | Cinematic post-FX (colour grade, tonemap, bloom, FXAA, sharpen, vignette, dither) + 2× SSAA; ambient occlusion off. |
| **Remaster** | `./build/ge007 --remaster --level dam` | The full remaster: adds screen-space ambient occlusion on top of the default look (uses the native Metal backend on macOS). |

The three preset flags are **transient and mutually exclusive** — none writes
`ge007.ini`. Every individual effect is also a `Video.*`/`Input.*` setting (with a
`GE007_*` env-var alias) you can toggle via `--config-override`; run
`./build/ge007 --list-settings` for the full list. HD texture packs are built from
*your own* ROM dump with `tools/texpack` and are never distributed. Full details:
**[docs/VISUAL_MODES.md](docs/VISUAL_MODES.md)**.

Useful runtime options:

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--rom PATH` | Load the ROM from `PATH`. A positional ROM path also works. |
| `--level NAME` | Direct-boot a supported solo stage by slug, for example `dam`, `facility`, `runway`, `surface1`, `bunker1`, or `egypt`. |
| `--level N` | Direct-boot a raw internal `LEVELID`. Example: `33` is Dam. These numbers are not mission-order numbers. |
| `--mission N` | Direct-boot solo mission order `1` through `20`. Use this when you mean "mission 2", "mission 3", etc. |
| `--difficulty VALUE` | Select the direct-boot difficulty. Values: `agent`, `secret`, `00`, `007`, or numeric `0` through `3`. Defaults to Agent. |
| `--savedir PATH` | Store `ge007.ini` and save data in `PATH`. Without this, the port uses the current directory when writable, then falls back to a per-user directory. |
| `--list-settings` | Print registered persistent settings and exit. Does not require a ROM. |
| `--dump-config` | Print the current config view after loading `ge007.ini` and exit. Does not require a ROM. |
| `--config-override KEY=VALUE` | Override a persistent setting for this run without saving it. Repeatable. |
| `--faithful` | Boot the pixel-/feel-faithful original (post-FX off, native res, stock textures, classic FOV, no modern crosshair/hitmarkers/minimap, vanilla pad aim) for this run only. Transient — does not modify `ge007.ini`. Explicit `--config-override` still wins. See [docs/VISUAL_MODES.md](docs/VISUAL_MODES.md). |
| `--faithful-hd` | Like `--faithful` but at 2× supersampling and HD-pack-ready (set `Video.TexturePack`). Transient; mutually exclusive with `--faithful`/`--remaster`. |
| `--remaster` | Boot the full opt-in remaster in one switch: ambient occlusion, bloom, filmic tonemap, colour grade, FXAA, sharpen, vignette, dither, 2× SSAA (native Metal backend on macOS). Transient; mutually exclusive with `--faithful`/`--faithful-hd`. See [docs/VISUAL_MODES.md](docs/VISUAL_MODES.md). |
| `--config-set KEY=VALUE` | Set a persistent config value, save `ge007.ini`, and exit. Repeatable. Does not require a ROM. |
| `--reset-config` | Reset registered persistent settings to defaults, save `ge007.ini`, and exit. Does not require a ROM. |
| `--no-input-grab` | Do not capture the mouse. Useful while testing windowed startup. |
| `--background` | Run without grabbing input and with background-friendly settings. Useful for smoke tests. |

If you pass no direct-boot option, the game starts normally. `--level` accepts
stage slugs or raw internal `LEVELID` values; `--mission` accepts campaign order.
For example, use `--mission 2` or `--level facility` for mission 2, not
`--level 2`. See [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md#running) for more platform
setup detail.

### Controls (default)

| Action | Keyboard & mouse | Gamepad |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move | `W` `A` `S` `D` | Left stick |
| Look | Mouse | Right stick |
| Fire | Left click | RT |
| Aim (hold) | Right click | LT |
| Cycle weapon | Mouse wheel | `Y` (next) / Back (prev) |
| Reload | `R` | — |
| Interact | `F` | — |
| Crouch (toggle) | `C` / `LCtrl` | L3 |
| Lean L/R (in aim mode) | `Q` / `E` | — |
| Watch menu | `Tab` | — |
| Pause | `Esc` | — |
| Mute audio | `M` | — |
| Show controls | `H` | — |

Mouse sensitivity, window size, display mode, and VSync are configurable in
`ge007.ini`. By default the port writes config/save data in the current
directory when it is writable; use `--savedir PATH` to keep a separate profile.
The display mode key is `Video.WindowMode` with `windowed`, `borderless`, or
`exclusive`; for example: `--config-set Video.WindowMode=borderless`. VSync is
`Video.VSync` with `off`, `on`, or `adaptive`; frame pacing is `Video.FrameCap`
with `30`, `60`, or `display`. Output gamma is `Video.Gamma`, where `1.0` leaves
colors unchanged.
`Video.RenderScale` adjusts the internal scene framebuffer from `1.0` to `4.0`
for supersampling. `Video.MSAA` accepts `0`, `2`, `4`, or `8` samples for scene
anti-aliasing.
`Video.HiDPI` controls Retina/high-DPI drawable rendering. It defaults to `0`
for steadier performance on large windows; set it to `1` for opt-in native
display-pixel rendering.
`Video.FovY` controls the normal gameplay vertical field of view from `45` to
`105` degrees (default `50` for a modern widescreen feel; `--faithful` restores
the classic `60`); scoped weapons and watch animations still use their own zoom
values.
`Video.RetroFilter` is `auto`, `off`, or `on` for the VI-style soft output
filter. `Video.Display` selects the zero-based SDL display index and falls back
to display 0 if the saved index is unavailable. `Video.WindowX` and
`Video.WindowY` are relative to that display, with `-1` meaning centered.
Run `ge007 --list-displays` to print detected SDL displays and fullscreen modes.
For `Video.WindowMode=exclusive`, set `Video.FullscreenWidth`,
`Video.FullscreenHeight`, and optionally `Video.FullscreenRefresh`; leave them
at `0` to use SDL's default display mode.
Pressing `H` also prints the full control list to the console.

## Known limitations

This is an experimental, work-in-progress port — **not** a 1:1 replacement for
original hardware. It runs the game's decompiled code natively; it is not an
emulator and is not cycle-exact. Rendering and audio use some documented
compatibility approximations, and a few areas are still converging toward exact
N64 behavior. **[PORT.md](PORT.md)** has the full, honest breakdown: what is and
isn't faithful, the known divergences, and the validation coverage. Please read
it before filing parity bugs.
