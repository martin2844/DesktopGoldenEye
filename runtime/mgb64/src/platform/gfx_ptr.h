/**
 * gfx_ptr.h — 64-bit pointer lookup table for GBI display list addresses.
 *
 * On 64-bit PC, GBI macros truncate pointers to 32-bit (unsigned int).
 * This table records full 64-bit pointers so the GBI translator can
 * resolve them. Game code calls gfx_ptr_store() via overridden macros;
 * the translator calls gfx_ptr_resolve() when reading addresses from
 * display list commands.
 *
 * Open addressing over the whole table with a per-slot state byte
 * (EMPTY/OCCUPIED/TOMBSTONE). Insert is lossless — it never silently evicts a
 * live mapping — and range invalidation tombstones (rather than zeroes) slots so
 * a deletion mid-probe-chain can never hide a still-live mapping (AUDIT-0009).

 *
 * Why a wholesale clear is safe — and semantically invisible on every width:
 * the registry is a resolution CACHE, and every live host pointer re-registers
 * within one frame of rendering because registration happens at DL submission
 * (osVirtualToPhysical / GFX_DL_REGISTER_PTR) and the game rebuilds its display
 * lists from scratch every frame. A per-stage clear therefore reproduces exactly
 * the empty-table conditions that every stage load already survives at boot: the
 * first frame of the next stage repopulates every entry it needs. The one class
 * the registry caches for a whole session — texture tex->data pointers — has an
 * independent, registry-less resolution backstop (the texture-arena low-32 scan,
 * gfx_resolve_loaded_texture_pointer_token), so clearing cannot make a still-live
 * texture unresolvable; the arena's own range-invalidation continues to guard the
 * freed case (see gfx_ptr_invalidate_range / image.c texArenaFreeAll).
 *
 * One clear fixes two lifetime defects at once (WEB-037):
 *   (a) evicts stale/freed entries whose low-32 token could otherwise shadow a
 *       genuine later N64 segment token, resolving REGISTRY-FIRST into garbage —
 *       the "stale registry" class, one level up from the Dam door-panel bug;
 *   (b) drops accumulated TOMBSTONEs so miss-probe chains cannot lengthen
 *       monotonically across a long (browser-soak) session.
 *
 * Resets ONLY occupancy (keys/vals/state). The cumulative diagnostic counters
 * gfx_ptr_full_fails / gfx_ptr_ambiguous / gfx_ptr_max_probe are session-long
 * render-health telemetry (AUDIT-0009) and are deliberately preserved so a soak
 * run's high-water marks survive stage transitions rather than resetting to
 * zero every level. */
