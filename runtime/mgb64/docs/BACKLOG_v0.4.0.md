# MGB64 v0.4.0 Backlog — "I'd rather play this than an emulator"

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development
> (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.
> Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Take the faithful mode from "cool project" to the preferred way to play — immaculate
image, complete gameplay, modern-feeling input and UI — while preserving the faithful sim.

**Architecture:** This is a *port*, not a 1:1 decomp. Sim behavior chases N64 parity
(oracle-validated where possible); presentation systems (text, HUD, settings, input) get
outright upgraded when that serves the player. Every behavior change ships with an A/B
escape hatch (`GE007_NO_*` for default-on fixes, opt-in flags for experiments) and a
validation route.

**Tech stack:** C (game/sim, Fast3D interpreter), Objective-C++ (Metal backend), C
(OpenGL backend), C++/ImGui (app shell), SDL2, CMake; tools in Python/shell under `tools/`.

## Global constraints

- Faithful mode with all fixes at defaults must stay deterministic: `sim_state_hash`
  invariance and the renderer parity lane must pass after every task.
- No ROM media enters the repo; release guards (`verify_asset_free.sh`,
  `check_sdk_inventory.py`, filename/history audits) must stay green.
- GL stays the default/byte-identical-everywhere renderer this cycle; Metal is the quality
  target on macOS and must reach GL parity, not diverge from it.
- Every default-behavior change lands with: (a) an env A/B hatch, (b) a
  `docs/ENV_FLAGS.md` regen, (c) a route or screenshot validation named in the task.
- Windows is the least-tested platform: any change touching `src/platform/` needs at
  least a MinGW cross-build check (`release.yml` dispatch or local `x86_64-w64-mingw32`).

## Execution standards — the anti-slop charter

Binding on every agent and human executing an item in this backlog. These are not
aspirations; a task that violates one of these is rejected in review regardless of
whether "it works." Each rule exists because we already paid for its absence once.

1. **Authority hierarchy.** For sim behavior: retail ASM / jump tables > ares oracle
   captures > the decomp C. The `#else` retail-reference bodies **lie** — never
   transcribe one into a native path (documented failure: the red-shard bug came from a
   skipped `#else`-only `totalsize` advance). Re-derive from the ASM/oracle and cite the
   anchor (e.g. `jpt_80054084`, oracle route name) in the commit message.
2. **Root cause before fix.** No symptom patches. A fix must name the mechanism in one
   sentence; if you can't, you're not done diagnosing. Heuristics are allowed only as
   explicitly-labeled bridges with a retirement condition written into the code comment
   (the pattern: `GE007_PORTAL_EDGE_RESCUE` exists *until* the portal BFS handles
   degenerate apertures — M3.4 then deletes it).
3. **Evidence before claims.** "Fixed" requires, pasted into the PR/commit: (a) the
   task's named validation route passing, and (b) the **negative control** — the A/B
   hatch or fault injection proving the validator catches the old behavior
   (`GE007_NO_BOND_BODY_FIX=1` must *fail* the intro validator). A validator that never
   failed anything validates nothing.
4. **Determinism is a gate, not a hope.** `sim_state_hash` invariance, the renderer
   parity lane, and (for opt-in features) identity-off byte-identity must pass on every
   task. Render-touching changes also run the perf census; >2% frame-time regression on
   the heavy routes (Jungle, Cradle) needs written justification.
5. **One item, one branch, one concern.** Commit messages cite the backlog ID (and
   audit ID where one exists). No drive-by refactors, no stacked unrelated fixes on one
   branch (the WORKFLOW.md anti-pattern — main once accumulated 8 unrelated fixes).
6. **Code reads like the codebase.** Follow `docs/CODING_STYLE.md`. Comments state
   constraints the code can't show — never narration ("now we check X"), never
   self-praise ("robust", "improved", "enhanced"), never review-chatter ("this fixes the
   bug by..."). Replaced code is deleted, not `#if 0`'d — the only sanctioned dead code
   is the `PORT_FIXME_STUBS && !NATIVE_PORT` retail-reference pattern.
7. **Flag discipline.** Every env flag is exactly one of: (a) a default-ON fix with a
   `GE007_NO_*` opt-out, (b) an opt-in experiment with a named owner and a
   promote-or-reap decision recorded in this backlog, or (c) a diagnostic. New flags
   register through the schema/env registry and regenerate `docs/ENV_FLAGS.md` in the
   same commit. Orphan flags are deleted on sight.
8. **Tool discipline.** A new `tools/` script is either wired into a suite
   (ctest/regression lane, listed in a doc) in the same PR, or it is a scout and gets
   **deleted when the investigation closes** — its conclusion goes into the relevant doc,
   not the filesystem. (The ~50-script `glass_*` sprawl is the cautionary example; MG.5
   pays this debt.)
9. **No placeholder work.** No TODO-later, no stubbed error paths, no "handle edge
   cases" comments, no silently narrowed scope. If an item can't be completed as
   written, stop and report what you found — a smaller true fix beats a larger fake one.
10. **Misdiagnosis is reportable, not embarrassing.** If implementation reveals the
    backlog/audit item mischaracterized the bug, update the document and say so
    (precedent: audit finding #1 misattributed the red shards; the correction was more
    valuable than the original finding). Never force the prescribed fix onto a
    different-shaped bug.
11. **Fresh-eyes review gate.** Every task gets a review (subagent or human) against
    this charter before merge. The reviewer independently re-runs the negative control —
    not just the happy path — and checks rules 6–8 mechanically.
12. **Docs are curated, not accreted.** Update the existing authoritative doc
    (STATUS.md, ENV_FLAGS.md, the audit, this backlog) instead of writing a new one.
    New standalone docs need a reason existing homes can't serve, and process artifacts
    (scratch analyses, one-off findings) never land in `docs/`.

## How this backlog was compiled (2026-07-08)

Synthesis of: `docs/RENDERER_SIM_AUDIT_2026-07-07.md` (R1–R19, with per-item status
re-verified against the working tree), the un-carried CONFIRMED findings from
`docs/RENDERER_SIM_AUDIT_2026-07-06.md` (each re-verified OPEN/FIXED in the current tree),
the intro/outro D-ledger, `docs/STATUS.md` / `docs/ROM_COMPARISON.md` validation-coverage
gaps, and six fresh code sweeps (gameplay/sim, renderer, HUD/text/menus, audio, platform/
app/CI, docs). Items verified fixed are in Appendix A so we stop re-auditing them.

**Priority:** P0 = broken/corrupt primary path · P1 = frequent player-visible defect ·
P2 = narrower visual/behavioral issue · P3 = hygiene/robustness/future-proofing.
**Effort:** S = hours · M = 1–3 days · L = 1–2 weeks.

## RX — Road to non-alpha v0.4.0: Release Readiness & UX

Added 2026-07-09 after shipping v0.4.0-alpha.2. The alpha→final gap is
**execution-and-polish, not more sim/renderer work** — M1 is complete and the hard
combat-parity items are walled behind a combat-field ROM oracle that does not exist
(structurally 0.5 material). Owner priorities for final: launcher/settings UX that is
controller- and touch-navigable, every setting explained with no dev/junk knobs shown,
and true fullscreen on Windows. Recon: three read-only surveys (2026-07-09) —
launcher/settings census, Windows-fullscreen root-cause, backlog reprioritization.

### Definition of done — what MUST be true to drop `-alpha`
1. Windows is **executed**, not just attested (MW.3 CI smoke green + one real-kernel run
   via MW.5 VM or MC.6 on-device).
2. Windows **true fullscreen** works (RX.3).
3. Launcher/settings UX is **player-grade** (RX.1 + RX.2): dev settings hidden, help
   visible without hover, controller/keyboard-free ROM load, handheld fullscreen+scale.
4. Controller-first is **complete for a handheld**: MC.2 (controllerdb+hotplug),
   MC.4 (rumble), MC.7 (real solo-pause).
5. macOS **signed + notarized**, OR an explicit documented owner decision to ship unsigned.
6. **M8.3 QA executed** — manual carryover run on hardware, 20-level Metal sweep, campaign
   34/34, MP/ASan/release-guard stack, STATUS/README refreshed.
7. Determinism rails green throughout (charter r4).

### RX.1 — Settings curation (the "no junk shown to players" mandate)
**P0 · M**
**DONE 2026-07-11** (landed incrementally + closed out this pass: 107 settings, tier split 67 player / 40 advanced; SMAA backend-gated; plain-language help pass over the graphics toggles; verified live on macOS + settings_menu_model/sim_state_hash/env_reference green). Code is the source of truth.
Census (survey 2026-07-09): 99 settings, **no player/advanced tier** — everything shows.
- [x] **Add an `advanced` (dev/diagnostic) tier** to the `Setting` struct (`settings.h:34-51`)
      + thread through `MgbCfgEntry` (`config_schema.h`); tag the ~30 dev knobs at their
      `settingsRegister*` sites (11 SSAO tuning: `SsaoMode/Radius/Intensity/Bias/Power/
      FarCutoff/NearCut/SkyCut/HalfRes/Blur/BlurDepthSharp`; 4 SunShadow tuning; `PerPixel
      Light`, `EnvSmoothNormals`, `EnvRelightBlend`; `BloomThreshold/Intensity`; ~8 ADS
      tuning sub-knobs; `WindowX/Y`; `MinimapShowAllEnemies`, `MinimapSharpOverlay`;
      `OutputFilterAlpha`; `DeviceSamples`). Gate them behind a collapsing "Advanced
      (expert)" disclosure per tab (`ui_settings.cpp:78-83`). Player tabs show only
      player-facing settings.
- [x] **Fix the STRING-setting bug** (`ui_settings.cpp:16-53`): `MGB_CFG_STRING` falls to
      `default:` → `Video.TexturePack` renders "(unsupported type)", uneditable. Add a
      read-only display + folder-picker, or hide string entries from the auto-list.
- [x] **Visible help, not hover-only** (`ui_settings.cpp:55-56`): render each setting's
      `help` as an inline caption (or a nav-focusable "?") — hover tooltips are invisible
      to controller/touch users, i.e. the whole handheld audience.
- [x] **Relabel/gate leaky entries:** `MinimapObjectives` ("once … implemented" =
      unimplemented feature exposed), `Smaa`/`SsaoMode` "Metal only" on a GL build,
      `FpsOverlay` help leaking `--deterministic`/`GE007_BACKGROUND`. Plain-language the
      jargon (`OutputDither`, `RetroFilter`, `HiDPI`, `Tonemap`, grade presets).
- [x] **Group the ADS family** (`platform_sdl.c:1925-1994`): 13 sub-knobs render even when
      `AdsEnabled=0` — nest under `AdsEnabled` with `BeginDisabled`, tuning ones → Advanced.
- [x] Validation: schema round-trip + `settings_menu_model` ctest; a headless dump proving
      player tabs exclude the advanced-tagged set; env/CLI overrides for advanced settings
      still work (hidden ≠ removed).

### RX.2 — Launcher/handheld UX pass
**P0 · M · MOSTLY LANDED (verified 2026-07-11) — touch pass gated on RX.5**
- [x] **Fullscreen-fill on launch** for handhelds (`ba0bb18`): `UI.LauncherFullscreen`
      (auto/on/off) borderless-fills the display; `auto` detects a small/high-DPI panel
      (`app_host.cpp autoWantsFullscreen`) and leaves desktop dev windows windowed.
- [x] **UI scale for a 7-inch panel** (`68ca47e`): `UI.Scale` (0.75–2.0) rescales the
      font + style metrics live for the launcher AND the in-game overlay.
- [x] **Reset-to-default affordance** (`0ad1dd0`): per-tab "Reset to defaults" footer
      (confirm popup) in the settings panel — calls `mgb_config_reset_default`.
- [ ] **Touch pass** (if RX.5 lands): larger hit targets, L1/R1 shoulder tab-switching with
      on-screen hints, touch-scroll of the settings/log children.
- [x] Validation: panel render smoke green; `rom_scan`/`settings_menu_model` ctests green;
      `sim_state_hash` unaffected; macOS launcher launch confirmed (no regression).

### RX.3 — Windows true fullscreen
**P0 · S-M · LANDED (verified 2026-07-11) — Windows-HARDWARE verification pending**
Landed: Fix A `eca323f` (apply mode on the adopted app-shell path too), Fix C `b13b51e`
(exclusive defaults to native res + falls back to borderless), Fix B `008882c` (Alt+Enter
returns to the configured mode). `platformApplyWindowMode()` now runs on BOTH the adopted
app-shell window and the engine-owned window (guarded off for the hidden/background window),
so `Video.WindowMode` is finally pushed to SDL on the Windows/macOS release path. Borderless
stays the safe cross-platform default; exclusive is opt-in/best-effort (Wayland can't
mode-set) and falls back to borderless on any mode-set failure. Compile-clean in a full
Release build (macOS). **Still needs Windows HARDWARE:** exclusive native-res, HiDPI on
1920×1200, alt-tab (no ROM in the CI env, so the engine-boot path that calls apply-mode
can't be driven headless here).

### RX.4 — Controller/keyboard-free ROM selection
**P0 · M · LANDED (verified 2026-07-11)**
Landed: `417b982` (auto-scan + in-app directory browser + `SDL_DROPFILE` drag-and-drop;
NFD kept as the mouse/desktop convenience), `a0fe528` (F1 review: escape AppConfig values so
a dropped/browsed ROM filename can't inject an ini line). Three pad-reachable paths to a
validated ROM: (1) auto-scan of `./`, `~/Downloads`, `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop`, `~`
(`rom_scan.cpp defaultScanDirs`, mirroring `main_pc.c:652`); (2) an in-app pad-navigable
directory browser (up/into, `..` first); (3) drag-and-drop. All flow through the unchanged
`mgb_validate_rom` + validation card. Verified: `rom_scan` ctest green + a live macOS
launcher screenshot showing an auto-detected ROM validated "Ready to play".

### RX.5 — Touch input wiring
**P1 · M**
No app-code touch wiring today (only SDL synth-mouse, so taps = clicks but no touch-scroll).
Wire `SDL_FINGER*` → ImGui touch (the vendored 1.92.9 backend supports
`AddMouseSourceEvent`); touch-scroll momentum for the settings/log children; verify taps
still hit the larger RX.2 targets. Not a hard blocker (synth-mouse works), but it's the
"touchscreen like the Ally" ask.

### RX.6 — Controller-first completion (from MC sprint, pulled to final)
- [x] **MC.2** — bundle `gamecontrollerdb.txt` + `SDL_GameControllerAddMappingsFromFile`;
      hotplug re-acquire without shifting P1's pad. **P1 · S.** *(LANDED — see MC.2
      section below. Loader lands mappings before any pad opens; hotplug was already
      instance-id-stable, verified not changed.)*
- [ ] **MC.4** — Rumble Pak → `SDL_GameControllerRumble` (faithful; output-only, sim-safe;
      `Input.Rumble` default ON + intensity). **P2 · S-M.**
- [ ] **MC.7** — real solo-pause: the overlay currently ships "game keeps running" (mid-
      combat death trap). Add a true solo pause when the overlay/settings open in single
      player. **P1 · M.**

### RX.7 — Windows execution lanes (credibility gate)
- [x] **MW.3** — `.github/workflows/windows-validate.yml` DELIVERED (dispatch): MSYS2 build
      (mirrors release.yml exactly) → import-table guard on real Windows → headless execution
      smoke (dummy drivers: config-schema self-check + `--dump-config` + update-check self-test,
      exit-code + stdout asserts) → ROM-free ctest subset (6 compiled C/C++ unit tests) →
      asset-free verify → upload .exe. The definitive "Windows runs" gate. actionlint-clean;
      every ROM-free smoke command + the ctest subset proven ROM-free locally before wiring.
      **Remaining: must be DISPATCHED + GREEN before the final release cut** (see RX.9 / M8.3;
      cannot self-run — dispatch needs the workflow on origin). **P0 · S-M.**
- [ ] **MW.5** — UTM + Win11-ARM eval VM: run the shipping x64 exe on a real Windows kernel
      (SEH/scheduler/fs). One real-kernel run satisfies the DoD without waiting on hardware.
      **P1 · M-L.** (MC.6 on-device is the ideal capstone but hardware-gated → validate the
      first 0.4.x, don't block final on a shipping date.)

### RX.8 — macOS signing + notarization
**P0-unless-waived · S (mechanics) + owner creds**
Signing wiring landed (`8a21ba1`) but inert without Apple Developer creds. A "final" that
Gatekeeper blocks on first launch isn't polished. **Owner decision:** provide creds to sign/
notarize, or explicitly accept shipping unsigned (documented in release notes + README).

### RX.9 — Final QA sweep + ship (executes M8.3)
**P0 · M**
Run the deferred manual carryover on hardware (rebind persistence, overlay-close gesture,
pad-nav feel, real-mouse wheel, radial-deadzone feel), the 20-level Metal minimap sweep,
campaign 34/34, MP/ASan/release-guard stack; recapture the perf baseline warm (kill the
thermal-flake gate); decide the FPS-overlay default-ON for final; enable the BUG-3 oracle
gate on the 19 sibling intro routes; refresh STATUS.md/README; cut v0.4.0.

**Release gate (MW.3):** the `Windows validate (execution)` workflow must be manually
dispatched on origin and finish GREEN on this release commit before the cut — it is the
"Windows executed" evidence (build + import-table guard + headless smoke + ROM-free ctest
on a real windows-latest kernel). See docs/WINDOWS_CONFIDENCE.md §4.

### Deferred to 0.4.x / 0.5 (explicitly NOT blocking final)
Everything oracle-gated (M2.3 Phase C/D, M2.5, M2.7 — needs the XL combat-field oracle);
the MG glass sprint (pixel-accuracy; correctness already ships); M4.2 HD glyphs, M4.4
languages; M3.1 Metal MSAA (real gap but macOS-only, L); M3.3/M3.4/M3.5/M3.6; M5.x audio;
M7.1 3/4-player (label beta); MW.4 Wine, MW.6 Docker; M6.5/M6.6.

## Execution status

**2026-07-08 — Week-1 batch LANDED** (`510e181..2a30542` + follow-ups, all on main,
whole-branch review verdict READY-WITH-MINOR-FOLLOWUPS, 0 Critical):
M0.1 ✅ M0.2 ✅ M0.3 ✅ (`9acba24`/`510e181`) M0.4 ✅ M8.1 ✅ (premise corrected:
gap was the prop pool, chr/player were pool-covered) M1.1 ✅ M2.1 ✅ M2.2 ✅ M2.4 ✅
M6.3 ✅. Windows/Linux validation waived by owner (stipulated-untested platforms;
best-practices bar stays). Details in `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`.

**M1.2 ✅ LANDED** (`a9f7348..5bbb18d`, 2026-07-08): fail-closed allocator contract,
30 direct + 25 wrapper-family call sites guarded, `g_dyn_overflow_count` health counter,
`GE007_DYN_STRESS_LIMIT` + `GE007_DYN_LEGACY_ALIAS` hatches. Two-round Fable review;
sustained-overflow stress (109 presented frames) crash-free, ASan/UBSan clean, defaults
byte-identical. Residual (overflow-regime only): `modelSetDistanceDisabled` leak on
early-returns (T9b, in flight). Lesson ledgered: caller sweeps must enumerate wrapper
families, not just direct allocator greps.

Deferred past 0.4.0 (tracked, deliberately not in scope): 120 Hz render interpolation
(F5 project — sim stays 60 Hz; needs a full transform-snapshot layer), MSVC support
(MinGW is the Windows toolchain), gyro aim, full netplay, menu mouse navigation.

## M0 — Land the in-flight work (days, do first)

The working tree already contains four finished audit fixes and one experiment that
needs a gating decision. Nothing else in this backlog should start until M0 is committed,
because M1–M3 build on these files.

### M0.1 — Commit R4/R5/R10: texLoad bounds, SETTEX checked alloc, N64 DL recursion cap
**P1 · S · done in tree, needs commit**
**Files:** `src/game/image.c:3333` (texture-ID bound → blank texture),
`src/platform/fast3d/gfx_pc.c:21573-21609` (dimension reject + `size_t` checked multiply),
`src/platform/fast3d/gfx_pc.c:22750` (`entry_depth >= 32` cap, restores
`g_effect_pending_child_label`, logs `[N64_DL_DEPTH_CAP]`).
- [ ] Run `tools/playability_smoke.sh --all` and the renderer parity lane; confirm zero
      `[N64_DL_DEPTH_CAP]` / texture-health errors on normal routes.
- [ ] Commit as three commits (one per fix) with the audit IDs in the message
      (`fix(fast3d): R10 …` etc.), regenerate `docs/ENV_FLAGS.md` if flags changed.

### M0.2 — Commit R7: minimap overlay on Metal
**P1 · S · done in tree, needs validation + commit**
**Files:** `src/platform/fast3d/gfx_metal.mm` (`gfx_metal_draw_minimap_overlay`: color-only
PSO + scissor, drawn in `mtl_end_frame` onto `present_src` before present),
`src/platform/minimap_overlay.c/.h` (backend dispatch,
`minimap_overlay_draw_queued_frames_metal`), `src/platform/fast3d/gfx_pc.c:24182`
(Metal skip removed).
- [ ] Run `tools/minimap_smoke.sh` twice: `GE007_RENDERER=metal` and default GL. Compare
      overlay screenshots; assert draw summaries match and no GL symbols execute under Metal.
- [ ] Verify `Input.MinimapEnabled=0` parity checks still pass under Metal.
- [ ] Commit; update `docs/RENDERER_SIM_AUDIT_2026-07-07.md` R7 status line.

### M0.3 — Gate and land D43: intro phase-3 animation + root-motion experiment
**✅ LANDED 2026-07-08** as `9acba24` (phase-3 anim + root motion, oracle-hash-matched) and
`510e181` (D31 grounding — Bond settles through the whole swirl, Y delta 0.00), both
oracle-validated on Dam with a 20-level regression pass. Remaining from this item: re-test
the D35/D36 waivers (folded into M1.5) and keep `GE007_NO_INTRO_PHASE3`/`_ROOTMOTION` as
the A/B hatches. Original task text kept below for reference.

**P0 (it changes every 1P intro) · M**
**Files:** `src/game/bondview.c` working-tree diff — `bondviewMaybeDriveIntroPhase3`
(fires `ANIM_aim_one_handed_weapon_left_right` at swirl seg 4 / timer 40, oracle-measured
frame delta 0.00), `bondviewDumpAnimHashesOnce` diagnostic, and a `GE007_INTRO_ROOTMOTION`
change in `playerTickBeams` (~`bondview.c:24437`).
**Problem:** the code comments say phase-3 is default-ON with `GE007_NO_INTRO_PHASE3` as
the A/B hatch, while the root-motion block is labeled "experiment (opt-in
GE007_INTRO_ROOTMOTION)" — but both currently read as default-enabled. These overlap the
unresolved intro transform-authority question (M1.3/R2); shipping two default-on movers of
the intro body invites regressions the D-ledger just waived.
- [ ] Decide the defaults: phase-3 anim default-ON (it is oracle-validated: onset, anim
      index 99, hash `0x79F92FB0`, end 96, hold-last-frame) with `GE007_NO_INTRO_PHASE3`
      A/B; root-motion **opt-in only** (`GE007_INTRO_ROOTMOTION=1`) until M1.3 makes one
      system authoritative for the intro body transform.
- [ ] Re-run the Dam intro oracle route (`dam_intro_swirl_bond_anim`) + `--trace-state`
      Bond trace; confirm anim-phase counters and camera-anchor drift (D35/D36) improve.
- [ ] Strip or env-gate the `[ANIM-HASH]` dump (`GE007_DUMP_ANIM_HASHES` is fine to keep).
- [ ] Commit; update the D-ledger: D43 landed, then re-test whether the D35/D36 waivers
      can be removed (that is D43's exit gate).

### M0.4 — Restore the design docs the backlog depends on
**P2 · S**
`docs/design/AUDIO_QUALITY_PLAN.md`, `docs/design/PERFORMANCE_PLAN.md`,
`docs/design/COMBAT_DEFERRED_PLAN.md`, and the intro/outro defect ledger (D-numbers) exist
only in git history or `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md` — `docs/CINEMATICS.md:99` points at
a "plan doc's defect ledger" that is not in the tree.
- [ ] Recover `git show 8de6d8d:docs/design/AUDIO_QUALITY_PLAN.md` (and the perf plan)
      into `docs/design/`; copy the D-ledger table into `docs/CINEMATICS.md` or a
      `docs/design/INTRO_OUTRO_LEDGER.md` and fix the dangling reference.
- [ ] Correct `docs/FRAME_TIMING_ARCHITECTURE.md:109`: the perf work IS present in the
      public tree by content (e.g. `gfx_opengl_compute_batch_snapshot_rect`,
      `g_room_cmd_cache_generation`), but merge hash `1b29b7a` is private-lineage; cite
      content, not the hash.

---

## M1 — Bond intro & the corruption class

The red shards are fixed (`50f3f61`), the alias fallback is fail-closed (R1 done). What
remains is the same memory neighborhood plus the transform-authority question — this
milestone makes the intro *provably* immaculate and makes buffer exhaustion incapable of
producing shards anywhere in the game.

### M1.1 — R9: guard the intro weapon sub-buffer load (underflow still possible)
**P1 · S (F1)**
**Files:** `src/game/bondview.c:3362` (weapon `load_object_fill_header` into
`bodyBuffer + totalsize`, size `bodyBufSize - totalsize`).
**Bug:** `totalsize` is advanced three times after the head guard (`:3269`, `:3276`,
`:3346`) with no re-check. If `totalsize >= bodyBufSize`, the size argument underflows and
the weapon load writes past the body buffer — the exact class that produced the red shards.
The `GE007_TRACE_BOND_BUF` block at `:3353` already computes the overlap; it is a print,
not a guard.
- [ ] Immediately before `:3362` add:
      `if (totalsize < 0 || totalsize >= bodyBufSize) { log one "[BONDVIEW][RENDER-HEALTH] intro weapon skipped: buffer exhausted"; skip weapon attach; }`
      (Bond renders unarmed rather than corrupt; every caller already tolerates a missing
      hand item via the R1 fail-closed paths.)
- [ ] Promote the `GE007_TRACE_BOND_BUF` overlap computation into the guard condition.
- [ ] Validate: Dam intro still shows the silenced PP7 (`ITEM_WPPKSIL` route assertion);
      a forced-small body buffer (`GE007_BOND_BODY_ALLOC_FAIL` variant or a debug clamp)
      skips the weapon without corrupting the body.

### M1.2 — R3 (remaining half): dyn-allocator caller fail-closed contract
**P0 · L (F4) — the last systemic shard generator**
**Files:** `src/game/dyn.c:129-205` and high-risk callers.
**Bug:** `9b9c4e2` stopped the OOB *writes*, but on overflow the allocators still return
the **current pointer** (`dyn.c:144`, `:188`, `:205`) or a **single shared scratch matrix**
(`dyn.c:166`). Two overflowing users in one frame overwrite each other's vertices/
matrices → warped limbs, bad billboards, flickering overlays. This is why "rare shards"
can still appear anywhere under memory pressure.
- [ ] Add a fail-closed mode: on overflow return `NULL` (and for the matrix allocator a
      distinguishable sentinel, e.g. the scratch matrix's address exposed as
      `dynIsOverflowMatrix(m)`), plus checked arithmetic on `count * 0x10` and aligned adds.
- [ ] Update callers in priority order, each skipping its draw on failure: model
      render-position allocation (`chr.c:5350` area), effect/billboard quads
      (`dynAllocate7F0BD6C4` users), glass shards, HUD rectangles, matrix producers.
      Grep callers: `grep -rn "dynAllocate" src/game/ | grep -v dyn.c`.
- [ ] Add `g_dyn_overflow_count` per-frame render-health counter; fail visual test routes
      when nonzero.
- [ ] Add `GE007_DYN_STRESS_LIMIT=<bytes>` to force small arenas; under stress the game
      must drop effects cleanly, never draw screen-spanning triangles.
- [ ] Validate: `tools/playability_smoke.sh --all` reports zero overflows at defaults;
      stress route degrades cleanly; ASan lane clean.

### M1.3 — R2: one authority for the intro body transform
**✅ RE-SCOPED + LANDED 2026-07-08** (`73afbfb`) — decision-gate option (b) per charter
rule 10. **P0 · L (F4)**
**Files:** `src/game/bondview.c:24558+` (post-`chrTickBeams` block in `playerTickBeams`).

**Original bug (as written):** in frozen intro modes the current-player prop was
corrected (snapped to `field_488.collision_position`) *after* `chrTickBeams` had already
advanced animation, allocated render positions, and built matrices — so the visible body
could be built from stale/animation-shifted state (floating/ungrounded Bond).

**Reassessment (charter rule 10 — the backlog text predates D43/D31).** This item was
written when intro Bond floated. Since then D43 (`9acba24`, scripted phase-3 anim + root
motion) and D31 (`510e181`, grounding across all intro phases) landed and are
oracle-validated (Y delta vs stock 0.00 through the whole swirl). That work restructured
the post-tick block: on **animated** frozen-intro frames the animation root motion drives
`prop->pos` and the block copies `prop->pos` **outward** to the collision anchor and
returns — it no longer snaps the anchor **into** the rendered prop. So the two-authority
structure R2 flagged no longer moves the rendered body during the swirl.

**Instrumented measurement** (`GE007_TRACE_INTRO_AUTHORITY`, Dam intro, 557 current-player
intro ticks): **zero** health warnings. On animated frames the outward branch runs (the
anchor delta tracks the animation's up-to-73u/tick settle and is propagated, not snapped
away); every frozen-intro **inward-snap** frame is a measured no-op. The animation inside
`chrTickBeams` is already the single authority for the swirl body.

**Decision:** the prescribed pre-`chrTickBeams` alignment refactor is **not** justified —
it has zero visual upside on an already-stock-correct scene and would fight the freshly
landed D31/D43 "animation drives prop" design (charter rules 2, 9). Instead the post-tick
block is demoted to a **logged consistency check**:
- [x] `GE007_TRACE_INTRO_AUTHORITY` diagnostic: per-tick prop pos before/after
      `chrTickBeams`, collision anchor, animation delta, anchor-snap delta.
- [x] One-shot `[BONDVIEW][RENDER-HEALTH]` warning if the inward snap ever moves the
      already-rendered viewer body by >0.01u in the frozen intro (non-FP) — i.e. if a
      second transform authority re-emerges. FP/FP_NOINPUT snap every tick by design and
      are excluded.
- [x] `GE007_INTRO_ROOTMOTION` gating settled by D43/D31 (default-on `GE007_NO_*` opt-out);
      not folded further here.
- [~] Pre-tick alignment refactor **deliberately not done** (see decision above; retire
      condition: if a future intro change makes the outward branch move the rendered body,
      the health warning fires and this item reopens as a true single-authority refactor).
- [x] Validate: log-only; `sim_state_hash` + `port_renderer_parity_smoke` green; Dam intro
      oracle-facing counters byte-identical to pre-change; M1.4 grounding check passes.

### M1.4 — R8: pixel-level intro validator (prove it, keep it proved)
**✅ LANDED 2026-07-08** (`dd36bad` trace/instrumentation, `3161b7a` validator + lane).
**P1 · M (F2)**
**Files:** `src/platform/port_trace.c` (`intro.bond_body`), `tools/audit_intro_trace.py`,
`tools/analyze_intro_body.py`, `tools/intro_visual_regression.sh`.
**Gap (closed):** actor-state checks (`bond_rendered=1`, anim hash) pass on a shredded or
floating Bond.
- [x] Extended the intro trace with the `intro.bond_body` record: world root, floor Y
      beneath Bond, model height, joint render-position count, and the body's projected
      screen bbox / root+head screen points. Grounding (`world_root.y` vs `floor_y`) is
      projection-independent.
- [x] Dam-intro screenshot analyzer (`analyze_intro_body.py`) with three checks:
      (1) presence = warm skin/tan silhouette coverage in the Bond region; (2) grounding =
      median `world_root.y - floor_y` within a bounded offset (fail on persistent float);
      (3) shard score = dark saturated-red outlier pixels → must be 0. **Note:** the port's
      frozen-intro camera does not project actor world positions to screen reliably, so the
      Bond region is an empirically-measured Dam-route fixture, not an engine projection
      (documented in the tool + INSTRUMENTATION.md).
- [x] Negative controls wired into `intro_visual_regression.sh`: `GE007_NO_BOND_BODY_FIX=1`
      FAILs presence (+ render_pos_count 6<18); `GE007_INTRO_BODY_Y_OFFSET=300` FAILs
      grounding (median 409.6>250); a dark-red injection self-test FAILs shards.
      `GE007_NO_INTRO_PHASE3=1` and `GE007_NO_INTRO_ROOTMOTION=1` both PASS (older-but-not-
      broken). `audit_intro_trace.py` also gained optional trace-only
      `--min-body-render-pos-count` / `--max-grounding-offset` gates.

### M1.5 — Close out the remaining intro D-ledger items
**P2 · M each — schedule after M1.3/M1.4 give measurement**
- [ ] **D37/D39:** static establishing-shot `cam_floor`/`cam_delta` divergence (Statue
      ~34u, Cradle ~9083u) — instrument the static-shot camera seed vs stock captures.
- [ ] **D38:** stock static-shot duration varies +3..+14 ticks while native is fixed —
      find stock's duration source (likely per-setup or load-driven), replicate.
- [x] **D41 — resolved as refuted / no gameplay fix 2026-07-22:** a fresh
      1075-record menu/direct comparison is bit-exact for camera and numeric animation,
      refuting the original ~3-tick port-path diagnosis. Preserved stock captures sample
      the same first 0.75 idle frame on different retail three-tick lattices (timer 100
      or 102); a fixed +0.25 native seed helped one and worsened the other, so it was
      removed before landing. The oracle now selects the settled last ares poll and
      event-aligns only the `ACT_BONDINTRO`→`ACT_STAND` identity boundary within one
      retail batch; numeric idle phase remains narrowly D41-waived until a game-tick
      stock trace exists. `gunhand` is wider boot-history PRNG state (FID-0063).
- [x] **D42 residual — camera-seed WALK, DECOUPLED + DEFAULT ON (T13b, 2026-07-09):**
      the headline "large map areas render as flat sky-blue" on establishing/intro
      cameras (Silo especially, also Dam) is FIXED default-on. Root cause (T13): the D42
      camera-seed fix *admits* the camera's resolved room but never walks its portals, so
      the BFS stops at the camera room + its one-hop supplement neighbors and everything
      further down the sightline (Silo 69→70→71→17; Dam 132→…→125) renders as the clear
      color. Walking the camera room fills it (Silo 3681→132 px, Dam ~4074→54 px). T13
      shipped this OPT-IN because walking into `room_rendered` is sim-coupled
      (`getROOMID_isRendered`→`PROPFLAG_ONSCREEN`→actor tick→`pcRandom`): the walk made
      more actors onscreen and shifted the deterministic intro camera pick, diverging
      `intro_oracle_dam_route`. **T13b decouples it:** the walk runs as the final admission
      step — snapshot the settled default `room_rendered`+`room_neighbor_to_rendered`, run
      the stock camera-room walk + the same edge-rescue/frustum-fallback/visibility-
      supplement passes (so it reaches EXACTLY the T13 rooms, including the ones only
      rescue/fallback reach past the pure BFS, e.g. Dam room 125), mark rooms added beyond
      the snapshot **draw-only** (in the draw list → geometry+props draw; invisible to every
      `room_rendered` sim consumer), then RESTORE the two sim-visible fields to the
      snapshot. Sim provably unchanged: 0 sim-critical trace diffs (RNG, onscreen, actors,
      vis.rendered/neighbor) vs walk-off across 599 frames on Silo+Dam; `intro_oracle_dam_
      route` unchanged; `sim_state_hash`/`renderer_parity`/`playability --all`/`minimap`/
      `hidden_guard` green; `GE007_NO_CAMERA_SEED_WALK=1` byte-identical (BMP+trace) to
      pre-T13b. Perf: draw-only set provably empty in gameplay (`camera_seed_room=-1`
      off-intro; `GE007_TRACE_DRAW_ONLY` probe = 0). Diagnostic left in tree:
      `GE007_TRACE_ROOM_CLASSIFY` (dropped-vs-far). Aperture residual (Silo 28/44,
      screen-edge sliver — rooms many winding-portal-hops away that even the T13 walk
      doesn't reach) → **M3.4**.
- [x] Re-test D31/D32/D35/D36 waivers after M0.3+M1.3 (fresh stock-ares/native
      pair, 2026-07-22): D36's animation identity/metadata/event-relative phase 3 are clean.
      Repeated natural-seed capture refuted deterministic `gunhand` parity; that one
      random mirrored-hand field is narrowly owned by FID-0063 instead. Correct
      ares timer deduplication now selects the settled last controller-poll record;
      the gated capture leaves D31 live at 1 divergence/max 0.26u, D32 live at one
      duration verdict/delta 2 records, and D35 live across 10 camera fields. The
      D36 verdict and D41 attribution are guarded by `intro_oracle_dam_bond_anim`; live residuals
      stay open.

## M2 — Gameplay feel & parity

The highest player-facing wins per hour in the whole backlog. Everything here is felt in
the hands within seconds of playing.

### M2.1 — Radial deadzone for the movement stick (slow-walk is currently dead)
**P1 · S**
**Files:** `src/platform/stubs.c:6322-6337` (P1), `stubs.c:5887-5900` (P2–4),
`GAMEPAD_DEADZONE` at `stubs.c:634`; reference implementation: the aim stick's radial
deadzone + rescale-from-edge at `src/game/lvl.c:5882-5895`.
**Bug:** the movement stick uses a per-axis square deadzone with a linear map — input
below the threshold is zeroed per-axis, killing slow-walk and making diagonal creep feel
notchy. The aim stick already got the correct radial treatment.
- [ ] Factor the aim stick's radial magnitude deadzone + rescale into a shared helper;
      apply it to the left stick in both pad paths before the ±80 N64-range map.
- [ ] Respect `Input.GamepadDeadzone` / `Input.GamepadRadialDeadzone` for both sticks.
- [ ] Validate: analog walk from stick center is smooth 0→80 (log the mapped magnitude);
      `tools/mp_smoke.sh` still green (multi-pad path touched).

### M2.2 — Mouse-wheel weapon cycling drops notches
**P2 · S**
**Files:** `src/platform/stubs.c:6267-6269`.
**Bug:** `if (wheel > 0) g_pcWeaponCycleForward = 1;` — N accumulated notches in one frame
collapse into one switch; fast scrolls feel unresponsive.
- [ ] Make the cycle request a signed count (`g_pcWeaponCycleSteps += wheel`); consumer
      steps `|count|` times in the cycle direction, then zeroes it.
- [ ] Validate: scripted 3-notch wheel event switches three weapons.

### M2.3 — Guard visibility/targetability: retire the render-visibility coupling
**P1 · L (F4) — the biggest remaining sim-parity item**
**Files:** `src/game/chr.c:5220-5238` (`GE007_CHRBEAMS_FRUSTUM` default OFF; room-rendered
bypass), `src/game/lvl.c:1737-1743` (zero-rooms fallback marks EVERY loaded room rendered),
`docs/design/COMBAT_DEFERRED_PLAN.md` (M1b per-player frustum union).
**Bugs (three coupled):** (1) `chrTickBeams` visibility defaults to "any of the guard's
rooms is rendered" instead of the retail frustum test `sub_GAME_7F054D6C`; (2) guard
auto-aim targetability and movement-AI mode key off that render-derived visibility, so
render fallbacks change *combat behavior*; (3) when the portal walk yields zero rooms, the
fallback marks all loaded rooms rendered — for that frame every guard is targetable and
"visible" through walls.
- [x] **Phase A (LANDED, `3a031c6`):** per-player frustum **union**
      (`chrBeamsFrustumVisibleUnion`, chr.c) evaluates `sub_GAME_7F054D6C` against every
      active viewport (set_cur_player + `sub_GAME_7F0785DC` recompute the per-player frustum
      planes), restoring the caller's player/planes; in 1P it is byte-identical to the single
      test. Default `GE007_CHRBEAMS_FRUSTUM` stays OFF. `GE007_TRACE_VISIBILITY` extended to
      characterize bypass-vs-union disagreements (over/under, viewer, `[VIS_PROBE_AGG]`).
- [x] **Phase B (LANDED, `f3a10c9`):** the `lvl.c` zero-rooms fallback now marks only the
      player's current room + direct portal neighbors (`bgMarkRoomAndPortalNeighborsRendered`,
      bg.c) with the marked count in the `g_portRoomRenderFallback*` render-health counters.
      Counter evidence: the fallback fires on none of the 20 playability levels (degenerate
      path only).
- [~] **Phase C (BLOCKED — NOT landed):** flipping `GE007_CHRBEAMS_FRUSTUM` default ON was
      A/B-tested but is **blocked**. Phase-A evidence is clean and supportive: across all 20
      playability levels every bypass-vs-union disagreement is "over" (frustum union ⊆
      room-rendered bypass), `under=0`, `viewer_disagree=0`. On-screen combat is unaffected
      by the flip: `hidden_guard_contract_smoke`, `dam_guard_pressure_contract`, and
      `dam_player_fire_guard_contract` pass **identically** flag-ON vs flag-OFF. **But** the
      flip deterministically shifts two calibrated campaign-route baselines — Bond position
      milestones, not combat: `dam_native_multiwaypoint_input_traversal` (post-input rest
      dz 2092 < 2200) and `bunker1_spawn_two_door_collect_contract` (post-second-door hdelta
      467 < 560). These are 1P routes (the union takes the no-switch path), so the sole cause
      is guards evolving under the retail frustum test instead of the room-rendered bypass —
      i.e. the *expected* faithful sim shift. Justifying the new baselines as faithful (per
      charter rule 3/4) requires the **Phase-5 combat-field ROM oracle** (COMBAT_DEFERRED_PLAN
      §2.1, "the single biggest blocker, XL") to confirm the frustum-culled guards match
      stock; that oracle is not built, so the shift cannot be evidenced as faithful and the
      default flip is deferred until it is. The union stays available and MP-safe behind
      `GE007_CHRBEAMS_FRUSTUM=1`; `=0`/default is the byte-identical bypass.
- [ ] **Decouple auto-aim/AI-mode from `getROOMID_isRendered`** — analysis done, largely a
      no-op: guard auto-aim targetability is set *solely* by `chrTickBeams` `visible` →
      `PROPFLAG_ONSCREEN` (object/door targetability already uses `sub_GAME_7F054D6C` at
      `chrobjhandler.c:11045`), so the flag flip *is* the auto-aim decouple. The remaining
      `getROOMID_isRendered` reads are **not** the coupling to sever: `chrprop.c:905/958` is
      render-pass draw dispatch (correctly render-set-driven); `AI_IFMyRoomIsOnScreen`
      (`chrai.c:2741`) and `AI_IFRoomWithPadIsOnScreen` (`chrlv.c:11739`, `aicommands.def`)
      are retail AI opcodes whose *defined* semantics are "is my room rendered" (distinct
      from `IF_GUARD_IS_ON_SCREEN`, which uses `PROPFLAG_ONSCREEN`); `chrIsPosOffScreen`
      (`chrlv.c:12726`) is already a room+fog+screen-box test. The one render-derived AI-mode
      read is `chrlvPropHasRenderedRoom` (`chrlv.c:11257`), which is the **M2.5** fog/
      WAYMODE_MAGIC bridge — a separate task (below). Reopens with Phase C.
- [ ] **Phase D — restore visibility-gated actiontype dispatch (retail H4):** deferred.
      Phase-A evidence bears on its risk: the frustum union is a strict subset of the current
      tick set with a large "over" population (e.g. L32 47%, L33 27% of samples), so H4 would
      stop full-ticking that many guards per frame — a real behavior change that (a) inherits
      the same Phase-C oracle-justification blocker and (b) would compound the same
      traversal-baseline shifts seen above. Do **not** implement until Phase C flips.
- [ ] Validate (for the eventual Phase C flip): `GE007_TRACE_VISIBILITY` under= and viewer=0
      on `tools/playability_smoke.sh --all` (**met**); combat gates pass (**met**);
      split-screen `mp_smoke.sh` green; auto-aim no longer acquires guards behind walls on
      the Dam guard-pressure route; Phase-5 oracle confirms frustum-culled guards match stock
      (**blocker**).

### M2.4 — HUD/watch timers jump on frame spikes (`speedgraphframes` unclamped)
**P2 · S**
**Files:** `src/game/unk_0C0A70.c:151` (raw assignment from `deltaFrames`), consumers
`src/game/bondview.c:9484,9492,13542,15758`, `src/game/watch.c:2472,9158,9202`; reference:
the `g_ClockTimer` cap at `src/game/lvl.c:2113-2126`.
**Bug:** alt-tab or a load spike feeds a huge `speedgraphframes` into watch/HUD timers →
visible timer jumps.
- [ ] Clamp `speedgraphframes` at assignment with the same 4-tick cap the clock uses (or
      route consumers through the capped tick).
- [ ] Validate: induce a 2 s stall (SIGSTOP/CONT); watch timer advances ≤ cap.

### M2.5 — Patrol force-loop workaround → fix the root cause
**P2 · M**
**Files:** `src/game/chrlv.c:11216-11218` (every patrol tick force-sets anim looping on
any guard), root cause chain: fog zeroing alpha → `PROPFLAG_ONSCREEN` never set →
`WAYMODE_MAGIC` path stalls.
- [ ] Fix the ONSCREEN determination for fogged-but-visible guards (ties into M2.3's
      frustum result — a guard in-frustum should be ONSCREEN regardless of fog alpha).
      **M2.3-Phase-A risk note:** the render-derived AI-mode read this task owns is
      `chrlvPropHasRenderedRoom` (`chrlv.c:11257`), which suppresses `WAYMODE_MAGIC` entry
      when a guard's room is rendered. It reads `getROOMID_isRendered` **directly**, not
      `PROPFLAG_ONSCREEN`, so it is unaffected by M2.3's frustum flip — but that also means
      M2.3's flip makes `PROPFLAG_ONSCREEN` *stricter* (adds the frustum's fog + screen-box
      test), so `lastvisible60` stops updating for fogged in-room guards behind Bond. The
      correct M2.5 fix (ONSCREEN = in-frustum regardless of fog alpha) must therefore land
      **with or before** the M2.3 Phase-C flip, or fogged patrol guards lean harder on the
      `chrlvPropHasRenderedRoom` bridge. Sequence M2.5 into the Phase-C landing.
- [ ] Remove the per-tick `modelSetAnimLooping` enforcement; keep it one release behind a
      `GE007_PATROL_FORCELOOP` compat flag in case a level regresses.
- [ ] Validate: guard patrol routes on Dam/Surface (walk cycles don't freeze); death/hit
      reaction anims (non-looping) still play exactly once.

### M2.6 — R6: ammo HUD fallback icon + image validation
**✅ LANDED 2026-07-08** on `fix/m2.6-ammo-hud`. **P1 · M (F2)**
**Files:** `src/game/gun.c:31752-31830` (`portGetAmmoImage`, `portDrawHandAmmo`),
`src/game/gun.c:31142-31165` (dimension trust), `src/game/image_bank.c:270-290`,
`src/game/bondwalk2.c:34-136` (`draw_textured_rectangle` clamping).
- [x] Add `portValidateImageEntry(const struct sImageTableEntry *img, const char *label)`:
      non-null, positive w/h, sane max (160 = 128 compiled-table max + 25% headroom),
      texture index bounded by the COMPILED `g_Textures` table via
      `texGetCompiledTableCount()` (the 340d892 idiom), **not** NUM_TEXTURES.
- [x] On invalid/missing icon draw a visible fallback (bordered rect glyph via the
      drawHitMarker FILL-rect texture-state-safe path) instead of silently drawing digits
      only, in both `portGetAmmoImage` consumers (hand HUD + `sub_GAME_7F06A334` watch
      readout); `g_hud_image_fault_count` HUD-health counter exported as
      `dl.hud_image_fault` and asserted zero by `audit_render_trace.py`.
      Fault hooks `GE007_AMMO_ICON_FAULT[_INVALID]=<ammotype>` = negative controls.
- [x] Clamp texture-rect right/bottom — resolved as **document, not clamp**: the PC path
      renders TEXRECTs as NDC triangles (GPU viewport clip, correct UV interpolation), and
      a coordinate clamp without S/T compensation would rescale instead of clip (cf.
      `gSPScisTextureRectangle`); mechanism documented in bondwalk2.c.
- [x] Validate: `tools/ammo_hud_smoke.sh` (ctest `port_ammo_hud_smoke`) equips all 13
      ammo-icon types on Dam, asserts icon pixels (equipped-vs-fault diff, digits cancel)
      + digit pixels (two ammo values, icon cancels) per type, GL and Metal both green;
      negative controls: digits-under-fault, invalid-entry validator path.

### M2.7 — Parity audits that need an oracle pass (schedule, don't rush)
**P2 · M each**
- [ ] **Shoot-out-lights coverage:** `src/game/bg.c:316-357` reconstructs the
      `light_fixture_table` by texture-ID heuristic (`check_if_imageID_is_light`) instead
      of retail's `texLoadFromGdl` population. Run the `GE007_LF_VERIFY` sweep (`bg.c:311`)
      per level against the ROM's fixture set; fix misclassified textures; key spans on
      tile-load boundaries where runs are mis-split.
- [ ] **stan.c seam parity:** `GE007_STAN_ONEDGE` (`src/game/stan.c:731`) family is
      validated but not frame-exact. Run the stan oracle comparator vs ares on
      multi-floor levels (Facility/Bunker stairwells); diff tile selection per frame.
- [ ] **SFX pan fidelity:** `src/platform/audio_pc.c:740` recomputes pan from
      `g_pcCamYaw` instead of the N64 game-computed pan (`snd.c:1226/1822`). A/B a few
      moving-source scenes vs ares; keep whichever matches.

### M2.8 — Surface the finished ADS feature
**P3 · S**
`Input.AdsEnabled` + 14 sub-flags are implemented (per-weapon `AdsProfile` pose authoring,
runtime gates — `src/game/gun.c:189-234`, `src/game/ads_profiles.h`) but ship buried in
the generic settings list.
- [ ] Add an explicit "Aim-down-sights (modern)" toggle row in `src/app/ui_modes.cpp`
      (default OFF, faithful-first); decide whether 0.4.0 documents it as a headline
      modern-mode feature.

## M3 — Immaculate image

Renderer correctness on both backends. Ordered: user-visible Metal gaps first, then
correctness sharp-edges, then the instrumentation-first audits.

### M3.1 — Metal: implement MSAA (the setting is silently ignored)
**P1 · M-L**
**Files:** `src/platform/fast3d/gfx_metal.mm` — `rasterSampleCount` hardcoded 1 at
`:1209, :2131, :2430, :2444, :2760`; draw-site PSO request `samples=1` at `:3206`; no
`alphaToCoverageEnabled` anywhere.
**Bug:** `Video.MSAA` works on GL but is a silent no-op on Metal, and A2C cutout
smoothing (foliage/fences) is unavailable — a direct image-quality gap on the flagship
backend.
- [ ] Allocate MSAA scene color/depth targets (`textureType:MTLTextureType2DMultisample`,
      sampleCount from `Video.MSAA`) with a resolve to the existing single-sample
      `present_src` chain (`storeAction:MTLStoreActionMultisampleResolve`).
- [ ] Thread sample count into the PSO cache key + descriptor; set
      `alphaToCoverageEnabled=YES` for the coverage-blend modes GL uses A2C for.
- [ ] Mind the snapshot path: `s_snapshot_tex` blits must read the resolved texture.
- [ ] The R7 minimap overlay PSO hardcodes BGRA8 + sample-count 1 — thread the same
      sample count through it (final-review note, 2026-07-08).
- [ ] Validate: GL-vs-Metal screenshot compare at MSAA 4x on Dam fences/foliage; perf
      check on the jungle route (MSAA is the most expensive knob — keep default as-is).

### M3.2 — Metal shadow & SSAO correctness trio
**P2 · S each**
- [ ] **Shadow depth clamp:** `mtl_shadow_encode` (`gfx_metal.mm:1631-1649`) never calls
      `setDepthClipMode:MTLDepthClipModeClamp` (the scene encoder does at `:1354`) —
      boundary casters get clipped where GL clamps. Add the one call.
- [ ] **Read-while-write hazard:** `gfx_metal.mm:3308-3311` binds `s_scene_depth` as the
      shadow-map fallback sampler while it is the live depth attachment. Bind a dummy
      cleared depth texture (or skip the shadow term) when `s_shadow_depth == nil`.
- [ ] **Autoreleasepool:** wrap every MSL compile body (`:696/718`, plus setup compiles at
      `:1179, :1577, :2116, :2417, :2738`) in `@autoreleasepool { … }` — compiler
      transients currently live until thread teardown.

### M3.3 — Texture-cache and interpreter sharp edges
**P2-P3 · S each**
- [ ] **Footprint-reject eviction** (`gfx_pc.c:15276-15296`): on implausible-footprint
      reject the code discards the *currently bound* cache node for the slot, evicting an
      unrelated healthy texture. Change to unbind/no-draw for the current tile without
      `gfx_texture_cache_discard_node`.
- [ ] **Base-GBI light moveMem bound** (`gfx_pc.c:20065`): `G_MV_L0..L7` indexes
      `rsp.current_lights[(index-G_MV_L0)/2]` with array size `MAX_LIGHTS+1 = 3` — L7 is
      an OOB write. Mirror the F3DEX2 bound (`:20046-20048`). GoldenEye emits F3DEX2 so
      risk is low, but it's a 2-line guard.
- [ ] **Matrix-stack push at depth 11** (`gfx_pc.c:16005`): silently skipped push, then
      `G_MTX_LOAD` clobbers the top. Add a render-health counter + one-shot log so a
      malformed DL is diagnosable.
- [ ] **Eye-intro prim-color bake** (`gfx_pc.c:15161-15162` vs cache key at `:21526`,
      struct `:944-955`): prim-modulated texels are cached without prim_color in the key —
      first prim wins on reuse. Add `prim_color.r` to the settex cache key for this path.
- [ ] **Texgen s16 overflow** (`gfx_pc.c:16901/16996-17004`): texgen U/V reassignment
      truncates to `short` for texture scale > 0x7FFF. Widen the intermediate and clamp to
      the tile's addressable range; log once if clamped.
- [ ] **G_SETBLENDCOLOR no-op** (`gfx_pc.c:22684, :23721`): store blend color as RDP
      state and add a diagnostic when a combiner references it, so we learn whether any
      live material needs it before implementing.
- [ ] **`texSelect` table bounds** (`src/game/othermodemicrocode.c:94/104/119/596`):
      the `< NUM_TEXTURES` (3001) checks share the 2698-entry compiled-table mismatch
      the R4 follow-up (`340d892`) fixed in texLoad — bound by the actual table.

### M3.4 — Train windows: fix the portal BFS, retire the heuristics
**P1 · M-L**
**Files:** `src/game/bg.c:2094` (`bgFindNearestRenderedRoomByAabb`), `bg.c:2160+`
(`bgApplyVisibilitySupplement`), `bg.c:2200` (neighbor_snapshot gate);
regression lane `tools/train_window_backdrop_regression.sh`.
**Bug:** retail's portal BFS reaches rooms behind grazing-angle windows/slats; the native
BFS drops them when the projected aperture collapses to an empty 2D bbox. Two default-on
heuristics (`GE007_PORTAL_EDGE_RESCUE`, the AABB-gap supplement) approximate it — Train
room-51 windows still show sky, and the over-broad variant can admit far terrain shards.
- [ ] Diff the native aperture projection (`bgProjectRoomAabbToScreenBbox` / portal clip)
      against retail for the degenerate-aperture case; make real portal edges survive with
      a clamped-to-pixel minimum aperture instead of empty-bbox rejection.
- [ ] Once the BFS reaches the rooms, retire `bgApplyVisibilitySupplement` (distance
      heuristic ≠ connectivity) behind a compat flag for one release.
- [ ] Validate: Train regression lane; `GE007_PORTAL_EDGE_RESCUE=0` as negative control;
      Dam room-14 far-terrain guard stays green.
- **T13 / T13b note (2026-07-09):** the D42/Silo establishing-camera blank-blue work
  landed the *seed/walk* half of this class DEFAULT-ON (the BFS now walks the camera room
  + the same rescue/fallback/supplement passes, DECOUPLED from the sim via a draw-only
  admission set — see the M1.5 D42-residual entry, now `[x]`). The M2.3 render→sim RNG
  coupling that blocked default-on is **resolved for this path**: draw-only rooms draw but
  are invisible to `room_rendered`/`PROPFLAG_ONSCREEN`, so extra visual admission no longer
  shifts the RNG. What remains squarely here is the aperture half: rooms directly visible
  across open space but reachable only through a long chain of grazing portals — Silo intro
  rooms 28/44 and a screen-edge sliver — which even the T13b walk (camera room + rescue +
  fallback + supplement) does not reach. `GE007_TRACE_ROOM_CLASSIFY` (`496370b`) is the
  diagnostic: it labels each unrendered frustum-visible room `dropped` (portal-adjacent to
  a rendered room — this task's target) vs `far` (multi-hop). The real fix is either (a)
  propagate the walk one bounded hop from supplement-admitted rooms, or (b) the clamped-min-
  aperture change already scoped above. **These can now reuse T13b's draw-only mechanism**
  (`g_BgRoomDrawOnly` + the snapshot/restore in `sub_GAME_7F0B8A6C`) to stay sim-invariant,
  rather than being blocked on M2.3. The
  `train_window_backdrop_regression.sh` lane currently FAILs on its own
  `PORTAL_EDGE_RESCUE` controls (rescue delta 0.000% on Train) independent of T13 — that
  control gap is part of this task's cleanup.

### M3.5 — Promotion decisions for parked default-off fixes
**P2 · S-M each — each is "validate, then flip or close"**
- [ ] **`GE007_DIAG_SETTEX_CC_COLOR_SCALE`** — frontend/briefing ~5-6% brightness residual
      fix, pending visual A/B sign-off. Do the A/B (menu + briefing screenshots vs stock
      capture), promote or document why not.
- [ ] **`GE007_TEXTURED_PROP_BULLET_IMPACTS`** — textured prop decals are opt-in because
      the textured path corrupted world texture state historically. Re-test on the current
      renderer (the texture-state fixes in RENDERING_REGRESSION_NOTES may have obsoleted
      the corruption); promote to default if the Dam decal probe passes.
- [ ] **`Video.EnvSmoothNormals`** — merged, default-off, "under review". Finish the blend
      tuning, decide default-off-but-in-`--remaster` vs stay experimental.
- [ ] **`GE007_EXACT_ROOM_SCISSOR`** — exact per-room N64 scissor boxes disabled by
      default (can under-cover interior seams). Route-test on Facility/Bunker interiors;
      promote or document.
- [ ] **`Video.HiDPI` default** (`platform_sdl.c:1595`) — off by default double-resamples
      on Retina; the macOS app shell already forces it on (`app_host.cpp:53`), so the SDL
      path is the odd one out. Benchmark fog/alpha-heavy stages at native backing scale;
      default ON where the GPU budget allows, keep the setting as the escape hatch.
- [ ] **HD-pack tooling gap:** `GE007_DUMP_LOADED_TEXTURES` emits hash-keyed dumps the
      runtime loader cannot consume (`texture_pack.c` loads `tok####.png` only). Make the
      dump emit token-named files (or teach the loader the hash key) so the dump→upscale→
      pack loop works end-to-end for world textures, matching the M4.2 font path.

### M3.6 — Audit-driven instrumentation items (R11, R15, R16, R17, R18, R19, R12)
**P2-P3 · instrumentation-first; no default behavior change without screenshots**
- [ ] **R11** RDP-memory snapshot census: **executed as MG.1/MG.2** (the glass sprint
      owns the instrumentation and the overlap-splitting fix); water/scope/fade
      materials found by that census that aren't glass get filed back here.
- [ ] **R15** depth audit: log every draw with `Z_UPD` without `Z_CMP` (class, material,
      room); classify and add targeted overrides only for proven cases.
- [ ] **R16** Metal degraded-target mode: classify targets required (scene color/depth)
      vs optional (snapshot/final/low-filter); optional failure disables the effect, not
      the frame (`gfx_metal.mm:1005`).
- [ ] **R17** mid-frame readback counters + warning outside diagnostic modes
      (`gfx_metal.mm:3148+`).
- [ ] **R18** private-storage texture upload path via staging blit for static textures;
      keep shared as fallback; upload/eviction counters first to prove it matters.
- [ ] **R19** `G_ZS_PRIM` false contract: add a diagnostic if it appears in live DLs;
      fix the lying comment at `gfx_opengl.c:1759`; implement only if a real material uses it.
- [ ] **R12** `gfx_ptr.h` registry: probe all four slots (or tombstones), add
      eviction/collision counters; bump associativity only if counters say so.

### M3.7 — Dam security-door panels render white [FID-0122]
**P2 · renderer · triaged — H1 (CI-palette fallback) UNREPRODUCED headless (2026-07-12 experiment); root cause unconfirmed**
2026-07-12 experiment result: ~15 headless captures (Dam start × many AUTO_WARP positions + full boot/menu) hit **zero** CI grayscale fallbacks and zero unregistered runtime-TLUT static loads — the AUTO_WARP never reached an interior door console, and every runtime TLUT was already palette-registered. A candidate fix (register the runtime TLUT palette under `static_texture_num`) was implemented then **reverted** (speculative, fires nowhere reachable). H2 (flat-quad `apptype==1` white prop) or a lighting/reachability factor now compete. **Needs a live/interior door-console capture to confirm the root cause before any fix.** Original H1 mechanism below still stands as the leading hypothesis.
User-reported (2026-07-12): the Dam security-door control panels
(`PROP_SEC_PANEL`/`PROP_DOORPANEL`/`PROP_DOORCONSOLE`, bondconstants.h:2826/3071/3072)
render white/gray instead of the intended retail green/red. Root cause is the known
CI-palette fallback class, **not** a missing door-state→color coupling (none exists;
the color is baked in the texture): a CI texture whose TLUT loads via the runtime
`G_LOADTLUT` path (`gfx_pc.c:20677`) is never keyed to its `texturenum` via
`texStorePalette` (`image.c:685`), so `texGetPalette` returns NULL and `gfx_pc.c:21732`
writes the grayscale-I8 fallback (`R=G=B=index` → white). Same class already fixed for
Dam guard faces + the alarm lens (`tools/dam_palette_regression.sh`); the door-panel
`texturenum`s are simply an uncovered set.
- [ ] Capture a Dam door panel (`GE007_TRACE_TEX_PIPELINE=1` + `GE007_DUMP_SETTEX_TEXTURES`)
      to pinpoint the offending `texturenum`(s) and confirm the `pal=(nil)` / grayscale hit.
- [ ] Fix by keying the runtime-`G_LOADTLUT` palette to the pending `texturenum` in
      `gfx_dp_load_tlut` (**shared path — validate no regression to already-correct textures
      across levels** via the renderer-parity + palette lanes), or route these textures
      through the compressed-paletted loader.
- [ ] Add the panel `texturenum`s to `COLOR_TEX_IDS` in `dam_palette_regression.sh`.
- [ ] Settle static-vs-state color intent with an ares/N64 RDP capture toggling the door
      locked→open (the white symptom is the palette fallback either way).

## MG — The glass sprint

Glass is the hardest remaining visual system and gets its own sprint. State of play:
transparent panes no longer vanish, crack decals are surface-aligned and lifted
(`explosions.c:183-254`), shards render by default (`GE007_GLASS_SHARDS=0` A/B) with the
shatter-crash and byte-swap hazards fixed (`alloc_window_pieces.c:29` registers the shard
buffer as native vertex data). What remains is *accuracy*: the pane compositing math, the
shard geometry scale, and trigger parity are all either measurably wrong or signed off by
nothing. Note: the "red shards" around intro Bond were a different bug (fixed `50f3f61`) —
this sprint is window glass.

### MG.1 — Center-glass framebuffer-memory blend: close the pad10092 pixel gap
**P1 · L — the core open glass bug**
**Files:** `src/platform/fast3d/gfx_pc.c` room-XLU coverage/RDP-memory classification
(`gfx_room_xlu_cvg_memory_gate_reason` and the `G_SETTEX` room-glass class,
`ROOM_GLASS_CC=0x00738e4f020a2d12`); context `docs/RENDERING_REGRESSION_NOTES.md` #13;
oracle route `tools/rom_oracle_routes/dam_regular_glass_shatter_pad10092_impact_visual_probe.json`.
**Bug:** pad 10092 is the Dam guard-tower window. The footprint-LOD fix made the pane's
*source fragment* correct (no longer black), but per the regression notes' own words it
was "a source-sampling fix only" — the RDP framebuffer-memory/coverage blend that
composites the tinted pane over the geometry behind it is still not stock-pixel-accurate.
This is the residual the entire 15-script `glass_pad10092_*` probe family was chasing.
- [ ] Instrument every draw using `diagRdpMemory`/`diagRdpCvgMemory` (this is audit R11's
      glass instance — M3.6's R11 bullet is satisfied by this task): material, draw
      class, screen rect, and same-batch overlap.
- [ ] Complete the coverage-memory blend for the room-XLU `G_SETTEX` glass class against
      the oracle capture: match blend inputs (memory color/coverage) per the diag CC
      signatures (`GE007_DIAG_XLU_RDP_CVG_MEMORY_BLEND_CC` / `_XLU_RDP_MEMORY_BLEND_CC`
      are the exact-match hypotheses to confirm or kill).
- [ ] Validate: `glass_pad10092_impact_visual_regression.sh` (or its MG.5 distilled
      successor) passes ROI pixel comparison vs the ares oracle on GL **and** Metal;
      `port_room_glass_source_reconstruction_guard` stays green; Frigate room-57 and the
      Surface/Jungle XLU coverage regressions stay green.
- [ ] Close out the diag-flag hypotheses this resolves: promote the winning behavior to
      default, delete the refuted `GE007_DIAG_XLU_*` alternates (charter rule 7), keep
      `GE007_DISABLE_ROOM_XLU_CVG_MEMORY` as the one A/B hatch.

### MG.2 — Overlapping coplanar panes read stale framebuffer memory
**P2 · M**
**Files:** GL batch path `gfx_opengl.c:2140-2279` (`gfx_opengl_compute_batch_snapshot_rect`),
Metal port `gfx_metal.mm:3099` (per-batch snapshot only; `GE007_XLU_SNAPSHOT_MODE`
not honored on Metal).
**Bug:** the per-batch snapshot (the Jungle perf win) is exact only for non-overlapping
coplanar panes — two glass panes in one same-material batch each composite against a
snapshot that lacks the other's contribution. This is the documented correctness trade
and it lands squarely on glass.
- [ ] Using MG.1's overlap instrumentation, detect same-batch overlapping
      framebuffer-read triangles; on overlap, split the batch at the overlap boundary
      (or fall back per-triangle for that batch only). Keep the fast path for the
      common non-overlapping case — do not regress Jungle/Cradle (charter rule 4).
- [ ] Honor `GE007_XLU_SNAPSHOT_MODE=pertri` on Metal so both backends have the exactness
      A/B, then compare GL-vs-Metal screenshots on Dam/Frigate glass scenes.

### MG.3 — Shard geometry scale: six flags in, one answer out
**P2 · M**
**Files:** `src/game/unk_0A1DA0.c:1266-1336` (shard model-matrix build; default correction
`1/bgGetLevelVisibilityScale()` at `:1311-1313`), coverage diag
`gfx_pc.c:5776` (`GE007_TRACE_GLASS_SHARD_COVERAGE`), scorer
`tools/compare_glass_shard_pixel_oracle.py`.
**Bug (RESOLVED — FID-0003, 2026-07-10):** the six competing A/B scale hypotheses were
collapsed to the one retail-ASM-faithful answer. The ROM (`sub_GAME_7F0A2C44`) draws
each shard unscaled; the port scales `field_10E0` by level visibility (0.2 on Dam/
Surface), so the shard must apply ×1/visibility to net to the ROM transform — the only
correct hypothesis (already the default), now coupled to `GE007_FIELD_10E0_SCALED` and
guarded by `port_glass_shard_scale_guard`. Original text below for history:
the native projection compresses shard triangles differently from N64, so the
tree carries **six** competing A/B scale hypotheses (`GE007_GLASS_SHARD_COMPRESS`,
`_BASIS_SCALE`, `_NO_BASIS_SCALE`, `_SQRT_BASIS`, `_INV_VIS_SCALE`, `_FIXED_MTX`) with an
empirical default that has never been signed off against stock. Shard on-screen
size/coverage is unproven.
- [x] Run the shatter route under each hypothesis with the coverage trace + pixel oracle;
      pick the one matching stock coverage, make it the unconditional code path.
      (FID-0003: retail ASM `sub_GAME_7F0A2C44` derivation; the ×1/visibility default was
      the one correct hypothesis, now the coupled code path.)
- [x] **Delete the other five flags** (charter rule 7 — this block is the poster child).
      (Done with FID-0003 — five env flags removed; the remaining `TRACE_GLASS_SCALE_*`
      enum in `port_trace.c` is internal instrumentation, not an A/B surface.
      Source-guarded by ctest `port_glass_shard_scale_guard`.)

Residual (open — NOT covered by the FID-0003 resolution above):
- [ ] Wire a shard-coverage regression (first-sample shard parity + NDC coverage budget)
      into the MG.5 glass lane so the answer stays locked (the landed guard is a
      source-level revert guard, not a coverage-budget lane) — track under FID-0005.
- [ ] While in the file: give the shard float-mtx path a fail-closed overflow (skip shard
      on `dynAllocate` failure) — this is M1.2's contract applied here; today pool
      exhaustion snaps every overflowed shard onto one matrix (07-06 #63).

### MG.4 — Parity questions that need an oracle verdict, then a default
**P2-P3 · S-M each**
- [ ] **Shatter-trigger parity:** nothing automated guards that native shatters a pane at
      the same hit/damage count as stock — `glass_route_parity_regression.sh` asserts
      same pane hit, same active shard count, same prop removal, but is manual. Wire it
      ROM-gated (MG.5); add a crack-count→shatter assertion to it
      (damage model: `objGetDamage`/`maxdamage`, `chrobjhandler.c:2560-2600`).
- [ ] **Tinted-glass minimum opacity:** the 16/255 near-clear floor
      (`chrobjhandler.c:572-628`) is a deliberate, *unvalidated* deviation — A/B
      `GE007_TINTED_GLASS_MIN_OPACITY=0` against the oracle, then promote one behavior
      and reap the flag.
- [ ] **Crack accumulation/fade:** cracks currently persist unbounded per pane; confirm
      stock behavior (fade? cap?) against the oracle before adding anything — if stock
      does neither, ours doesn't either (faithful default), and we only add a cap if a
      degenerate accumulation case shows up in soak.
- [ ] **Classifier fallback hardening:** `gfx_room_xlu_cvg_memory_gate_reason`'s
      material-signature-only fallback (`dl_room<0 && dl_which==NULL && !room_matrix &&
      prim.a==0`) has no spatial key — harmless today (both branches converge), fragile
      under partial attribution. Add a spatial key or a converging assertion.

### MG.5 — Pay the glass tooling debt (charter rule 8 made concrete)
**P2 · S-M**
~49 `glass_*` scripts exist; only ~11 are wired (the ctest guards +
Surface/Jungle XLU smokes). The rest are spent scouts whose conclusion is already
recorded in `RENDERING_REGRESSION_NOTES.md` #13.
- [ ] Build **one** ROM-gated glass lane (`tools/glass_regression_lane.sh`) from the four
      load-bearing unwired scripts: `glass_route_parity_regression.sh`,
      `glass_material_regression.sh`, `glass_visual_oracle_regression.sh`,
      `glass_pad10092_impact_visual_regression.sh`; document it in INSTRUMENTATION.md and
      run it in the M8.3 release sweep.
- [x] Delete the ~34 one-off scouts (the other `glass_pad10092_*` probes, `glass_actor_*`,
      the isolation/scout variants, and `analyze_*`/`score_*`/`compare_glass_projection_*`
      helpers not referenced by a wired guard). Their findings live in the regression
      notes; the scripts are spent. One commit, listed by name, revertable.
      (Done `c0efdec`: 25 scripts reaped by proven-zero-reference closure, not 34 —
      `glass_actor_masked_visual_regression.sh`/`glass_impact_visual_isolation_regression.sh`
      had since become semi-wired via `dam_visual_regression_suite.sh` run_gate lines, and
      `glass_active_visual_isolation_regression.sh`/`glass_pad10092_impact_visual_regression.sh`
      are held pending remaster coordination per
      `docs/design/remaster-aaa/04-content-geometry-effects.md`. The four
      load-bearing-unwired scripts named in item 1 above, and their
      `compare_glass_*`/`analyze_room_glass_required_source.py` dependencies, were kept
      untouched.)
- [ ] Keep the six ctest glass/XLU guards untouched.

**Definition of done for the sprint:** the glass lane + shard-coverage regression pass on
GL and Metal; pad10092 ROI matches the oracle; exactly one shard-scale code path and one
opacity default remain; the `tools/` glass surface is ≤ 15 files, every one wired or
documented.

## M4 — HUD, text & UI overhaul

The "port, so make it better" milestone. The text stack already supersamples glyphs 3×
(`GE007_FONT_UPSCALE`) and widescreen 2D is solved — what's missing is player control,
true crispness, and languages.

### M4.1 — Register the env-only presentation knobs as real settings
**P1 · S — highest value-per-hour in the milestone**
The F1 overlay auto-renders every schema key (`src/app/ui_settings.cpp:63`), so each of
these is one `settingsRegister*` call plus replacing the `getenv` read:
- [x] `Video.FontUpscale` (1–8, default 3) ← `GE007_FONT_UPSCALE` — **landed** (registered
      in `platformRegisterConfig`, renderer reads `g_pcFontUpscale`, env still overrides via
      the settings path; `SETTING_SCOPE_RESTART`). Still open: `FontAlphaCutoff`/`FontWhitePoint`/
      `FontPoint` (`gfx_pc.c:14991/:15008/:14980`) if they prove player-meaningful.
- [ ] Crosshair/reticle size-color-thickness ← `GE007_ADS_RETICLE_THK/GAP/LEN/DOT/OUTLINE`
      (`src/game/gun.c:33788`), plus a classic-crosshair scale.
- [ ] `Game.Language` enum (see M4.4), HUD-scale/opacity if trivially wireable.
- [ ] Verify the `Audio.Master/Music/SfxVolume` sliders actually appear and live-apply in
      the F1 Audio tab (buses are wired — `audi_port.c:201`, `music.c:1335`,
      `audio_compat.c:4950`); add to the native watch options menu only if we want
      in-fiction parity.
- [ ] Regen `docs/ENV_FLAGS.md`; keep env vars working as overrides.

### M4.2 — HD glyph path: truly crisp text everywhere
**P1 · L — the headline "prefer this over an emulator" upgrade**
**Files:** `src/platform/fast3d/gfx_pc.c:15081` (`gfx_upload_font_texture_i8`),
`gfx_pc.c:3767` (`gfx_is_font_texture_addr`), `src/game/textrelated.c:320`
(`text_dump_font_glyphs`), `src/platform/texture_pack.c:64` (loader pattern).
**Gap:** glyphs are authored at ~8-13 px; the 3× bilinear supersample makes them smooth
but soft at 4K. The HD texture pack loader is keyed on settex tokens and never sees font
uploads, so HD text is currently impossible.
- [ ] Extend `gfx_is_font_texture_addr` to return `(font_bank, glyph_index)` for a glyph
      upload (both banks are fixed 94-glyph tables loaded at known addresses in
      `load_font_tables`, `textrelated.c:468`).
- [ ] In `gfx_upload_font_texture_i8`, before the supersample, try
      `<pack>/fonts/<bank>_<index>.png` (mirror `texture_pack_try_load`'s stat + miss-cache
      design). On hit, upload the HD RGBA at N× native dims — UVs unchanged because tile
      dims stay native, exactly like the settex HD path.
- [ ] Author the atlas: use `text_dump_font_glyphs` to enumerate the 94 glyphs per bank;
      re-render at 4× from faithful-looking typefaces; ship as an optional pack (or bundle
      — glyphs re-rendered from fonts are not ROM media, but confirm provenance policy).
- [ ] Validate: side-by-side menu/briefing/HUD screenshots at 4K; faithful mode with pack
      absent is pixel-identical to today.

### M4.3 — Crosshair quality
**P2 · S-M**
`drawHitMarker`/`drawModernAdsReticle` (`gun.c:33711/33766`) are already resolution-scaled
vector drawing; only the default classic crosshair is still the low-res `crosshairimage`
texture (`gunDrawSight`, `gun.c:33836`).
- [ ] Either route `crosshairimage` through an HD-pack token or add a faithful-styled
      vector variant reusing the reticle drawer; expose size/color via M4.1 settings.

### M4.4 — Language support (PAL/JP banks)
**P2 · M**
**Files:** `src/game/lvl_text.c:78` (`j_text_trigger`, build-time), `:87` (lookup tables),
`:376` (JP multibyte glyph path, already implemented), `:458` (`langLoadToAddr`);
`assets/obseg/text/` currently ships only `*E` English banks.
- [ ] Extract/convert the PAL `*P` banks (Fr/De/It/Es) — and J if feasible — into the same
      header/asset format (they come from the user's ROM at runtime for the port paths;
      confirm which side of the asset-free boundary the text banks sit on and follow it).
- [ ] Register `Game.Language`; flip the lookup column + `langLoadToAddr` reload on change.
- [ ] Verify accented glyph coverage (é ü ñ) in the Gothic/Zurich banks; supplement via
      the M4.2 HD atlas if glyphs are missing.

### M4.5 — Intro caption polish
**P3 · S**
Mission-intro location/time captions already render (`bondview.c:6954/6965` via
`hudmsgBottomShow`). Make duration/styling consistent at all aspect ratios and optionally
toggleable. (A full subtitle system is N/A — GoldenEye has no spoken dialogue.)

### M4.6 — 21:9 menu spot-check
**P3 · S**
The aspect system is solved in code (`gfx_pc.c:16137/21087` pane-centered squeeze); do a
manual pass of every menu (watch tabs, folders, briefing, MP setup) at 21:9 and file
anything misplaced. `watch.c:538` has a leftover HACK comment (font-char pointer
arithmetic) — read it while there.

---

## M5 — Audio polish

Audio is in strong shape (no crackle/underrun bugs, queue-mode output, authentic
polyphase resampler, volume buses wired, RAW16 byte-swap fixed). FID-0141's final
low-FPS risk is also closed: the live queue controller now follows a measured
pump-interval EMA, preserving its ~50 ms cushion at 40/30 fps while remaining
exactly at the old 368-sample base at 60 Hz; see
`docs/fidelity/derivations/FID-0141-audio-pump-ema.md`. What remains:

### M5.1 — Resolve H2: envelope/pole sample-ordering (last open DSP question)
**P2 · M**
**Files:** `src/platform/mixer.c:39-40` (`MIXER_ENV_SAMPLE_XOR_DEFAULT`/`POLE` = 0),
used at `:588` (env) and `:732/740/757` (pole).
- [ ] Run the existing capture + `compare_audio_reference.py` A/B against ares for both
      xor settings on a music-heavy route; lock the winning default and delete the loser
      or keep it as a documented A/B hatch. Record the verdict in the restored
      `docs/design/AUDIO_QUALITY_PLAN.md`.

### M5.2 — H3: per-instrument bank loop/tuning audit
**P2 · M**
The "cheap instruments, Surface 2 worst" report was never converted to measured deltas.
- [ ] Run the Phase-0 reference capture for gameplay levels (Surface 2 + a control level);
      diff per-instrument. Only touch the bank parsers
      (`audio_compat.c:99-341`, `bank_make_adpcm_loop` ~`:139`) if the capture confirms a
      defect. Also covers STATUS.md's "final reverb balance" follow-up.

### M5.3 — Optional 48 kHz output stage
**P2 · M — biggest cheap fidelity win on modern hardware**
**Files:** `src/platform/audi_port.c` (final mix path around `:483`),
`src/platform/audio_pc.c:26` (`PORT_AUDIO_RATE` 22050).
- [ ] Add an opt-in final polyphase upsample 22050→48000 before `osAiSetNextBuffer`
      submission and open SDL at 48 kHz when enabled (`Audio.OutputRate` enum:
      22050 native / 48000). The synth stays at 22050 — pitch math depends on it.
      Default OFF to preserve byte-identity.
- [ ] Validate: null test at 22050 (flag off = identical bytes); listening check + spectral
      compare at 48 kHz.

### M5.4 — Audio hygiene
**P3 · S each**
- [ ] Delete the dead simple-synth in `audio_pc.c` (`musicNoteOn`, `calcNotePitch`,
      `findInstSound`, `musicMixSamples`, `portMusicPlaySequence`, legacy MIDI parser at
      `:2361` — zero external callers; keep device open, volume buses, spatial-mix).
- [ ] Remove/annotate the dead distance-attenuation branch in `portAudioComputeSpatial`
      (`audio_pc.c:751` — real path passes `attenOut=NULL`, `snd.c:1199`).

---

## M6 — Platform & Windows hardening

### M6.1 — Windows diagnostics are a no-op (players can't report bugs)
**✅ LANDED 2026-07-09 with MW.1 (`fix/mw1-windows-scrutiny`)**
**Files:** `src/app/diag_log.cpp` — the `_WIN32` branch was stubbed; POSIX tees to
`mgb64.log` with rotation and feeds the F1 diagnostics view.
- [x] Implemented the Windows tee: `_pipe` + `_dup2(1/2)` + reader thread into
      `SDL_GetPrefPath("MGB64","MGB64")\mgb64.log`, same prev-rotation (with
      delete-before-rename — Windows `rename()` won't replace), same ring buffer;
      `_IONBF` because the Windows CRT treats `_IOLBF` as full buffering.
- [ ] Validate on a real Windows machine or Wine: log file appears, F1 diagnostics
      populate, crash diagnostics from M6.2 land in it (MW.4/MW.5 lane).

### M6.2 — Windows crash handler: remove the SEH-UB `longjmp` path
**✅ LANDED 2026-07-09 with MW.1 (`fix/mw1-windows-scrutiny`)**
**Files:** `src/platform/main_pc.c`, `src/platform/fast3d/gfx_pc.c`,
`src/platform/platform.h`; POSIX path (`sigaction`+`SA_ONSTACK`) untouched.
- [x] On Windows: `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` writes `[CRASH] Unhandled exception
      <code> at <addr>` + the shared `[CRASH-DL]/[CRASH-TEX]` dump and terminates;
      `signal()` kept only for SIGABRT; the recovery `longjmp` is compiled out and
      `recovery_enabled` forced 0 on `_WIN32` (a set `GE007_ENABLE_RECOVERY` logs
      "unsupported on Windows").

### M6.3 — Config-parsing safety
**P3 · S**
- [ ] `src/platform/config_pc.c:227-229`: unmatched enum token falls back to raw
      `strtol` with no range clamp — clamp to `[0, enum_count-1]` or reject.
- [ ] `src/platform/port_env.c:41-44`: `get_or_create` ignores the `kind` of an existing
      entry — a reused name type-puns the value union. Kind-check, log, ignore on mismatch.

### M6.4 — Gamepad button rebinding
**P1 · M — most-requested missing input feature**
**Files:** `src/app/ui_bindings.cpp` (keyboard-only capture; footer at `:72-73` admits
"Gamepad (fixed)"), `src/platform/input_bindings.c`.
- [ ] Add a gamepad binding table parallel to the scancode one; capture
      `SDL_CONTROLLERBUTTONDOWN` in the existing rebind flow; persist via the schema.
- [ ] Optional: `Input.LookCurveExponent` response-curve slider while in the area.

### M6.5 — CI: protect the platforms we ship
**P2 · S-M — weigh against the deliberate no-hosted-auto-trigger provenance posture**
**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml:9` (dispatch-only), `release.yml:57-82` (Windows job
has no smoke-launch and no asset-free verify; Linux does both at `:45-51`).
- [ ] Add a lightweight `pull_request` lane: hygiene checks + Linux build + ROM-free ctest.
- [ ] Add a Windows MinGW build job to `ci.yml`; mirror smoke-launch +
      `verify_asset_free` into the Windows release job.

### M6.6 — Launcher/startup niceties
**P3 · S each**
- [ ] ROM SHA-1 advisory: `mgb_validate_rom` checks size + title signature but not
      `ge007.u.sha1` — on explicit selection, warn (don't block) for non-matching hashes
      (ROM hacks/PAL) since behavior is unvalidated there.
- [ ] Linux: document `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11` Wayland fallback in README troubleshooting;
      consider a flatpak manifest (M, optional).
- [ ] Decide the shipping default for the FPS/frame-time overlay (currently default-ON by
      choice; fine for beta, revisit for 0.4.0 final).

## MW — Windows/Linux confidence sprint (zero-cost)

Added 2026-07-09 at owner request. Goal: **to the best of our knowledge, the Windows
build WILL compile, run, and play correctly** — established through intense scrutiny
plus real execution on free infrastructure, with no Windows hardware purchase. This is
a legitimacy requirement for the port, distinct from the per-batch validation waiver
(which stands for day-to-day development). Linux gets the same treatment at lower cost
since Docker is already proven here.

### MW.1 — Fable deep-scrutiny review of the entire Windows surface
**✅ DONE 2026-07-09 (`fix/mw1-windows-scrutiny`) — attestation: `docs/WINDOWS_CONFIDENCE.md`**
Enumerate and audit EVERY `_WIN32`/`__MINGW32__` branch and every platform-divergent
assumption in the tree. The known-pitfall checklist to sweep exhaustively:
- [x] Struct layout: `-mno-ms-bitfields` on ge007/ge007_lib; mgb64_app carries no
      N64-layout structs and its engine seam has no bit-fields (layout-safe by
      construction). No new bit-field seam structs since v0.3.2.
- [x] printf/scanf format portability: `-Wformat` live tree-wide in the MinGW lane
      (1 hit, fixed); UCRT (local lane) native C99 formats; msvcrt (release CI)
      auto-enables `__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=1` for C11/C++17 — header-verified.
- [x] File IO: all ROM/save/trace writers use explicit binary modes + `MoveFileExA`
      atomic replace; text-mode fopen = logs/ini only. Fixed: config path buffers
      were `PATH_MAX` (260 on Windows) vs the 1024-byte savedir contract.
- [x] POSIX-only calls outside guards: none (compile/link truth + hand sweep of the
      semantics-divergent class: clock_gettime/dirent/write all winpthreads/CRT-safe).
- [x] The Windows no-op stubs — ALL THREE LANDED: diag log (M6.1, CRT-fd tee),
      crash handler (M6.2, SEH filter + recovery-longjmp compiled out), watchdog
      (full breadcrumb rig now compiles on Windows).
- [x] Env/locale: setenv shims cover both call sites; parser trims `\r` via isspace;
      no setlocale → stable C-locale float parsing.
- [x] SDL2 Windows specifics: GL 3.3 core/WGL via stock SDL path + glad; Metal
      Apple-gated; WASAPI via SDL default device; controllers = SDL_GameController
      only (XInput-ready for the Windows handheld).
Deliverable shipped: 6 fixes (M6.1, M6.2, watchdog, LLP64 diag formats, PATH_MAX
truncation, math-shim `lround`), 61-warning census triaged (3 real → fixed; 58
remaining attested benign), `docs/WINDOWS_CONFIDENCE.md` attestation. Runtime-only
gaps are enumerated there and belong to MW.3-MW.5.

### MW.2 — Local MinGW cross-build lane (compile/link truth on macOS)
**P1 · M**
- [ ] `brew install mingw-w64`; obtain SDL2 for the cross target (fetch the MSYS2
      `mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2` package archive or build SDL2 from source with the cross
      toolchain — document which, pin the version to what release CI uses).
- [ ] CMake toolchain file (`cmake/mingw-w64-x86_64.cmake`) + `tools/mingw_cross_check.sh`
      that configures, builds `ge007.exe`, and fails on any warning the MSYS2 CI build
      would reject. Wire as an optional ctest lane (off by default, on for release).
- [ ] Acceptance: cross-build green locally reproduces the release CI compiler surface
      closely enough that "it compiles in CI" stops being a push-and-pray event.

### MW.3 — Real Windows execution, free: GitHub Actions validation lane
**P1 · S-M · the definitive gate — public-repo runners cost nothing**
`origin` is the public repo (akratch/mgb64): GitHub-hosted `windows-latest` runners are
free for public repositories. This is real Windows hardware without buying anything.
- [x] Added `.github/workflows/windows-validate.yml` (workflow_dispatch, per the repo's
      no-auto-trigger posture): MSYS2 build (mirrors release.yml exactly) → import-table
      guard on real Windows objdump → headless execution smoke (SDL dummy audio/video
      drivers; ROM-free surfaces: `MGB64_APP_DUMP_SCHEMA` config-schema self-check,
      `--dump-config`/`--list-settings` automation path, `MGB64_UPDATE_CHECK_SELFTEST`
      negative control — exit-code + stdout asserts) → ROM-free ctest subset (6 compiled
      C/C++ unit tests) → asset-free verify → upload the .exe artifact. Render-path smoke
      is deliberately EXCLUDED (needs a GPU/display the headless runner lacks — that is
      MW.5's job); documented in WINDOWS_CONFIDENCE.md §4. actionlint-clean.
- [x] Documented the loop in WINDOWS_CONFIDENCE.md §4: dispatch → read results / download
      artifact. Wired as a release-cut gate in RX.9 + M8.3.
- [ ] Stretch: a community-tester path — the uploaded artifact + a 5-minute test script
      for any Windows-owning contributor.

### MW.4 — Wine runtime smoke on macOS (free)
**P2 · M**
- [ ] `brew install --cask wine-stable` (free; runs x86_64 PE via Rosetta). Run the
      MW.2-built `ge007.exe` headless with SDL dummy drivers against a local ROM —
      validates PE loading, CRT behavior, SDL2 Windows code paths, and (critically)
      runtime struct-layout behavior that static review can't prove.
- [ ] Wire as `tools/wine_smoke.sh` (muted, headless). Document the limits honestly in
      WINDOWS_CONFIDENCE.md: Wine is not the Windows kernel — SEH, scheduler, and GPU
      driver behavior differ; it raises confidence, it does not conclude it.

### MW.5 — Real Windows kernel without hardware: UTM/QEMU VM (free, heavier)
**P2 · M-L · optional but closes the "real kernel" gap**
- [ ] UTM (free) + Windows 11 ARM evaluation media, unactivated (Microsoft permits
      unactivated use; watermark only). Windows 11 ARM's built-in x64 emulation runs
      the shipping x86_64 `ge007.exe` on a REAL Windows kernel — SEH, real scheduler,
      real filesystem semantics — on this Mac.
- [ ] One-time setup documented; keep the VM as the release-QA rig: run the game with
      a ROM, play 10 minutes, run the headless smoke suite. This plus MW.3 makes the
      attestation strong enough to publish.

### MW.6 — Linux lane revival (Docker already installed)
**P2 · S-M**
- [ ] `tools/linux_docker_check.sh`: dockerized Ubuntu build + ROM-free ctest + headless
      boot smoke (x86_64 image; the historical Docker verification proved this works —
      revive and pin it). AppImage launch smoke inside the container.
- [ ] Wire into the M8.3 release checklist beside MW.3.

**Sequencing:** MW.1 + MW.2 first (pure local, no new tools beyond brew), MW.3 next
(one workflow file), MW.4/MW.6 as runtime confidence, MW.5 once before the next public
release. M6.1/M6.2 (Windows diag log + crash handler) are prerequisites of the MW.1
attestation — a platform whose diagnostics are a no-op cannot be called supported.

## MC — Controller-first & handheld sprint

Added 2026-07-09 at owner request: the owner is acquiring an ASUS Windows handheld (Windows
gaming handheld). Its controls present as a standard XInput/Xbox-layout gamepad, which
SDL2's GameController API abstracts identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux — so the
correct architecture is generic SDL2 controller support, no per-device or per-platform
code. The handheld constraint that actually bites is **no keyboard or mouse**: every
surface a player must touch (launcher, settings, F1 overlay, rebinding) has to be
fully controller-navigable. The Ally doubles as the MW sprint's real-Windows test
hardware once it arrives (MC.6).

### MC.1 — Controller navigation for the app shell (launcher/settings/F1 overlay)
**P1 · S-M — the handheld blocker; ImGui does most of the work**
The ImGui shell is currently mouse-driven. ImGui ships gamepad navigation:
`ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad` + feeding SDL controller state into the ImGui IO
(SDL2 backend does this when enabled).
- [ ] Enable gamepad nav in the app shell (src/app/), verify every panel is reachable:
      launch flow (ROM select → Play), settings tabs, bindings page, diagnostics.
- [ ] Ensure focus-visible styling so nav state is visible on a 7" screen; map B =
      back/close, Back/View = toggle overlay (alongside F1). *(r10 correction per the
      MC.1+MC.3 review, F2 — this bullet originally said "Start = toggle overlay",
      written before the displacement cost was weighed: Start = watch is GoldenEye's
      core system interaction, and Back's only prior duty was the port-invented
      weapon-prev binding, so pad Start stays the N64 Start and weapon-prev moved to
      the R-stick click.)*
- [ ] Acceptance: complete a boot → settings change → play → overlay toggle → quit
      session using ONLY a controller (validate with any pad; re-validate on the handheld
      at MC.6).

### MC.2 — Controller database + hotplug robustness
**P2 · S — LANDED**
- [x] Bundle/refresh the community `gamecontrollerdb.txt` (SDL_GameControllerDB, free)
      and load it at init (`SDL_GameControllerAddMappingsFromFile`) so exotic/hybrid
      devices map correctly on all platforms; keep SDL's built-ins as fallback.
      Done: `lib/sdl_gamecontrollerdb/gamecontrollerdb.txt` (zlib-licensed community
      DB, full upstream copy — passes the provenance guards as plain-text mapping data,
      not a ROM asset), loaded by `platformLoadControllerMappings()` in
      `src/platform/platform_sdl.c` **before** the pad-open loop in `platformInitSDL`.
      Resolution order (last-write-wins per SDL semantics): `SDL_GetBasePath()` (bundle/
      exe dir, where packaging drops the file) → CWD → savedir override. Missing file is
      non-fatal — logs "using SDL built-in mappings" and boots. Proven headless/muted:
      loads 183 macOS-platform mappings from the bundled file (SDL counts only the host
      platform's entries; the other ~2000 are Windows/Linux/Android/iOS and are skipped);
      negative control (db removed) logs the built-ins fallback and boots. Packaging wired
      into all three lanes (`macos/Scripts/build_gl_app.sh` → `.app/Contents/Resources/`,
      `scripts/package_windows_zip.sh` next to `ge007.exe`,
      `scripts/package_linux_appimage.sh` → `usr/bin/`). Provenance in `THIRD_PARTY.md`.
- [x] Verify hotplug: connect/disconnect mid-game re-acquires cleanly (the MP per-pad
      slots must not shift P1's pad); document behavior. **Already robust — verified, not
      changed.** `g_pads[PLATFORM_MAX_PADS]` uses fixed player slots keyed by
      `SDL_JoystickID`: `SDL_CONTROLLERDEVICEADDED` opens into the first *free* slot and
      rejects duplicates (`platformOpenPad`); `SDL_CONTROLLERDEVICEREMOVED` frees only the
      slot matching the removed instance id (`platformClosePadByInstance`) — no cascade,
      no promotion of P3→P2, P1 (slot 0) untouched unless P1's own pad is removed. A
      reconnect takes the first free slot (usually its own, since other slots are
      undisturbed); note SDL assigns a *new* instance id on replug, so there is no
      persistent identity across unplug — if a different pad grabs the freed slot first,
      the returning pad lands in the next free slot (standard free-pool behavior, P1 still
      stable). MC.4 rumble indexes `g_pads[player].handle` by the same slot, so slot
      stability keeps rumble addressed to the right player; a disconnected slot's NULL
      handle no-ops safely. Full unplug/replug proof is hardware-gated → MC.6 / M8.3.

### MC.3 — Gamepad button rebinding (absorbs M6.4)
**P1 · M**
The keyboard rebinding UI exists (src/app/ui_bindings.cpp); gamepad is fixed-layout.
- [ ] Parallel gamepad binding table + capture flow (`SDL_CONTROLLERBUTTONDOWN`), schema
      persistence, reset-to-default; triggers as axes with threshold.
- [ ] Optional while in there: `Input.LookCurveExponent` response-curve slider.

### MC.4 — Rumble (faithful: GoldenEye is a Rumble Pak title)
**P2 · S-M**
- [ ] Wire the game's existing Rumble Pak signal path (find the motor on/off calls in
      the N64 layer — os motor/pfs calls, likely stubbed in stubs.c) to
      `SDL_GameControllerRumble` (works on Xbox/DualShock/Ally alike). Setting
      `Input.Rumble` default ON with intensity scale; deterministic-run safe (output
      only, no sim state).
- [ ] A/B: rumble on Klobb pickup / damage per stock behavior; zero sim-hash impact.

### MC.5 — Handheld ergonomics profile
**P3 · S**
- [ ] Verify 1920x1200 (16:10) presents correctly (aspect system is pane-based — spot
      check HUD/menus); document a recommended handheld config (FrameCap for battery,
      HiDPI off, text scale once M4.1/M4.2 land).
- [ ] No code unless the 16:10 spot-check finds a defect.

### MC.6 — Ally validation session (when the device arrives)
**P1 · S — also serves MW attestation**
- [ ] Run the MW.3 CI-built (or MW.2 cross-built) `ge007.exe` on the handheld: install,
      ROM setup, full controller-only session (MC.1 acceptance repeated on-device),
      Rumble check, performance notes (Z1 Extreme is far above spec), and the
      watchdog/diag-log behavior on real Windows (M6.1/M6.2 must be landed first).
- [ ] Feed results into docs/WINDOWS_CONFIDENCE.md as the real-hardware section.

### MC.7 — Real solo-pause for the F1/View overlay
**P2 · M — RC follow-up (review F2)**
- [ ] The overlay currently only swallows input (`onWantsInput`) — the sim keeps
      ticking while it is open, so opening settings mid-combat leaves Bond defenseless.
      The alpha.2 RC ships with the honest footer wording ("game keeps running") as the
      stopgap; this item adds the actual suspension.
- [ ] Suspend the solo sim while the overlay is open (route through the watch-pause
      path, or gate the sim tick on `platformOverlayWantsInput()`), keeping MP unpaused
      (or lockstep-safe). Faithful pause semantics: mirror GoldenEye's watch pause, not
      a hard freeze, where that matters.
- [ ] Determinism gate: `sim_state_hash` invariance must hold with the overlay never
      opened (automation has no overlay hooks, so this is a no-op there — assert it).
- [ ] On landing, drop the "game keeps running" footer back to a "Paused" wording and
      remove the F2 known-issue from the RC notes.

**Sequencing:** MC.1 + MC.3 are the pre-Ally software work (any pad validates them);
MC.2/MC.4 ride along cheaply; MC.6 becomes the capstone of BOTH this sprint and MW
once the hardware arrives. Ally note: its pad is active in the device launcher "Gamepad"
mode — a setup step for the user, not a code concern.

## M7 — Split-screen multiplayer

2-player is green (distinct viewports, render-health clean). GoldenEye's defining feature
deserves the full matrix.

### M7.1 — 3/4-player validation + scoreboard
**P1 · M-L**
**Files:** `src/game/lvl.c:1713/1722` (`viSetupScreensForNumPlayers`), `src/game/mp_watch.c`
(scoreboard/results), `tools/mp_smoke.sh`.
- [ ] Extend `mp_smoke.sh` to 3-player (asymmetric split — the risky viewport math) and
      4-player with per-quadrant dissimilarity assertions.
- [ ] Drive a full round to completion; assert the scoreboard/results transition renders
      (this is the open "scoreboard/results transition proof" in STATUS.md).
- [ ] Sustained-load frame budget on the heaviest MP stage with
      `room_render_fallback_records == 0` (interacts with M2.3's fallback narrowing).
- [ ] Label 3/4-player "beta" in the launcher until this passes.

---

## M8 — Validation rails & release

### M8.1 — sim-hash must cover the prop/chr BSS ✅ (FID-0030 verified)
**P2 · S-M — DONE (S-Tier Task 0.4)**
Sim-hash coverage is now a **checked property**, not tribal knowledge.
- [x] Prop-record pool (`pos_data_entry`) registered earlier (M8.1 premise fix).
- [x] Stan collision navmesh/saved-collision-cache/BFS scratch registered
      (`stanBuildHashRegions`, `src/game/stan.c`); RNG seed (`g_randomSeed`) and
      the `g_BgRoomInfo` room-visibility read-back (FID-0012 rule — a
      render-written field consumed by sim is NOT waivable) registered too.
- [x] `tools/fidelity/hash_coverage_audit.py` cross-references **every** writable
      (`.data`/`.bss`) decomp symbol against the live region table
      (`ge007 --print-sim-hash-regions`, ROM-free) and dispositions each as
      hashed / waived (`docs/fidelity/hash_waivers.txt`, categorical reasons) /
      UNCOVERED. Exit 1 on any UNCOVERED. Registered as ctest
      `fidelity_hash_coverage` (verify manifest tier 1). Current audit: 0
      UNCOVERED (3316 writable symbols; 26 hashed, 3285 waived-with-reason).
- [x] Re-baselined: `sim_invariance_gate` green (OFF==ON with the new regions),
      Dam screenshot + state-trace byte-identical vs the pre-change build (only
      the internal hash *value* shifted, as expected once).

### M8.2 — Route/validation expansion (the honesty gap)
**P2 · ongoing**
The stock-ROM oracle lane is Dam-only; ~12 stages have placeholder intro routes with empty
waivers; objective/report/exit contracts are scripted, not organic.
- [ ] Capture stock traces for the 8 classified stages' swirl/anim routes; then the 12
      uncaptured stages (ledger T25) in priority order: Facility, Bunker 1, Surface 1/2,
      Frigate (the campaign spine).
- [ ] One organic mission-completion route (menu → objectives → report → save) for Dam as
      the template, then Facility. The scout non-promotions (Surface 1 key ~3,652u short,
      Bunker key pad 8, Surface II bridge ~25,120u short) stay documented as open until an
      organic route or better scout closes them.
- [ ] Set a numeric soak budget: `tools/soak_stability.sh` N-hour per-stage run with zero
      crashes/render-health failures as a release gate (currently "no budget claimed").

### M8.3 — Release QA sweep + ship
**P1 · M**
- [ ] Week-1 manual-QA carryover (2026-07-08 review): controller-in-hand feel check of
      the radial movement deadzone (M2.1); real-mouse multi-notch wheel scroll (M2.2,
      no runtime validator exists — 3 notches must give 3 switches); full 20-level
      Metal minimap sweep (M0.2 validated 3 levels); MinGW/Windows CI build of the
      week-1 batch if not already dispatched.
- [ ] Run the manual priority list from `RENDERING_REGRESSION_NOTES.md` (Dam glass/decals/
      truck, Surface snow + sky-fog boundary, Cradle bridge/fog/faces, Silo/Depot/Train/
      Caverns corridors) on GL and Metal, plus the M4 UI screens at 16:9/21:9/4:3.
- [ ] Full gate stack: `native_playability_regression_suite.sh`, campaign routes 34/34,
      MP lanes, save persistence, ASan lane, release guards.
- [ ] Update STATUS.md (it currently undersells the port), README known-issues, ENV_FLAGS
      regen; `scripts/release.sh` for all three platforms per RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md.
- [ ] **Dispatch `.github/workflows/windows-validate.yml` (MW.3) on the release commit and
      confirm GREEN** — the Windows-executed gate (build + import-table guard + headless
      smoke + ROM-free ctest on windows-latest). Blocks the cut. See WINDOWS_CONFIDENCE.md §4.

| H1 output low-pass | resolved REJECT on ares evidence; plumbing kept default-off |

Refuted/policy (don't reopen without new evidence): G_FOG re-assert on world geometry is a
deliberate, guarded port workaround (`gfx_pc.c:19953-19961`); N64 3-point filtering IS
emulated on Metal (`n64TextureFilter`, `gfx_metal.mm:338`); doppler absence is faithful;
MSVC support is deliberately out of scope (`CMakeLists.txt:32`).

## Appendix B — Suggested sequencing & sizing

Rough serial order inside the parallel tracks (sim, renderer, UI/platform can proceed
concurrently once M0 lands):

1. **Week 1:** M0 (all), M8.1 (sim-hash BSS — early so it guards the rest), M1.1, M2.1,
   M2.2, M2.4, M6.3.
2. **Weeks 2-3:** M1.2, M1.3+M1.4 (pair them), M2.6, M3.2, M3.3, M4.1.
3. **Weeks 3-5:** M2.3 (+M2.5 rides it), M3.1, M3.4, **MG.5 then MG.3/MG.4** (tooling
   lane first so the sprint has its measurement rail), M6.1, M6.2, M6.4, M5.1-M5.3.
4. **Weeks 5-7:** **MG.1 then MG.2** (the hard glass work, after the lane exists),
   M4.2-M4.4, M3.5, M3.6, M6.5, M7.1, M2.7.
5. **Week 8:** M8.2 minimum bar, M8.3, ship v0.4.0.

The single highest-leverage items if forced to choose six: **M1.2** (kills the corruption
class), **M2.3** (combat correctness), **M2.1** (game feel in 2 hours of work), **MG.1**
(the hardest visual problem — glass compositing), **M3.1** (Metal stops ignoring MSAA),
**M4.2** (crisp text — the thing every screenshot shows).

## Remaster texture track — recomp survey imports (2026-07-10)

From `docs/RECOMP_LANDSCAPE_SURVEY_2026-07-10.md` (F7, F15, F16); RT64's
field-proven texture-pack model. Folds into the Phase-2 HD-pack track
(`tools/texpack/`, `src/platform/texture_pack.c`):

- **MG-tex.1 (policy, adopt now — F7):** `tools/texpack/build_pack.py` grows a
  **BC7-DDS** emit path (via `texconv`/`bc7enc`, ~¼ the VRAM of RGBA32 PNG) plus a
  `--low-mip-cache` output (all lowest mips in one file, loaded at start as instant
  placeholders → kills pop-in). PNG stays dev-only. **Platform gotcha:** macOS
  OpenGL 4.1 lacks BPTC/BC7; Metal on Apple silicon supports BCn natively — another
  reason Metal is the forward path (GL keeps PNG fallback).
- **MG-tex.2 (loader, Tier 2 — F15):** successor to the synchronous PNG-on-first-use
  loader — async **stream** mode (default) with low-mip placeholder on miss, **LRU
  eviction** sized to VRAM budget, `.zip`/zstd pack mounting alongside the directory
  layout, multiple stacked packs. Keep the `G_SETTEX`-decode hook. ImGui pack-select
  UI deferred (Z64R merged the framework with no menu — infra first, launcher later,
  no coupling).
- **MG-tex.3 (keying, Tier 2 — F16):** replace the collision-prone 12-bit
  `tok####` token key with a **content hash over staged TMEM bytes** (RT64's XXH3-
  over-TMEM model; check RT64 license before lifting `rt64_tmem_hasher.h`, else
  reimplement from their documented algorithm). Fallback order content-hash → token;
  teach `build_pack.py`/`validate_pack.py` a manifest. Bonus: hashes double as
  texture-identity assertions for fidelity lanes.
- **F17 (texture-decode sense lane):** exercise RGBA32 half-TMEM split, TLUT masking,
  odd-row word swap against hardware-verified expectations (Wiseguy ROMs if public —
  open question O3 — else n64-systemtest-class suites under ares as proxy). Divergences
  become normal FID cycles. Hardens exactly the paths the HD-pack hook rides on.
