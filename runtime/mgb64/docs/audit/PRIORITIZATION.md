# Native-Port Audit: Prioritized Findings Report

Scope: the full native-port defect ledger produced by the Codex audit,
`docs/audit/issues/AUDIT-0001` through `AUDIT-0073` (73 findings). This report
ranks them into a recommended fix order and clusters them by theme. It is a
reading of the ledger metadata (severity, priority, evidence) plus the source
anchors in each report; the individual reports remain authoritative.

Internal document (docs/audit is export-ignored). No ROM-derived data appears
here or in the reports it summarizes.

## Ranking method

Each finding is ordered by three keys, most significant first:

1. **Priority** (the maintainer's intended repair order): P0 < P1 < P2 < P3.
2. **Severity** (impact): S1 < S2 < S3 < S4.
3. **Evidence strength** (confidence it is real and reproducible): runtime /
   fault-injected / test / A-B reproduced, then source-plus-mechanism, then
   source-only.

Lower sorts earlier = fix earlier. The tiers below follow that order.

## Distribution at a glance

| | P1 | P2 | P3 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| S2 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 5 |
| S3 | 22 | 19 | 3 | 44 |
| S4 | 0 | 13 | 9 | 22 |
| **Total** | **24** | **37** | **12** | **73** |

Read-through: only **2** findings are top-severity (S1), and both are release
supply-chain integrity. There are **no S1/S2 defects marked P1** other than those
two, so the ledger has no "crash-on-every-boot" class open. The bulk (44) is S3
correctness/robustness, split roughly evenly between P1 (clear before a release
candidate) and P2 (correctness backlog). The 22 S4 items are polish.

## The single biggest risk: the release/CI pipeline

The largest and highest-severity cluster is not gameplay -- it is the machinery
that builds, certifies, and signs releases. Both S1s live here, plus a long P1
tail. If a release is cut before these are fixed, the release itself can be
wrong or unverifiable even when the game is fine:

- **AUDIT-0037 (S1)** Linux packaging runs an unpinned mutable download (supply
  chain).
- **AUDIT-0052 (S1)** Release assets are not bound to the verified source commit
  (provenance).
- **AUDIT-0053 / 0058 / 0059 / 0070 (P1/P2)** macOS/Linux builds miss the release
  version; a Linux job "succeeds" without producing an AppImage; packagers allow a
  missing SDL runtime; Gatekeeper rejection is nonfatal to signing.
- **AUDIT-0012 / 0019 / 0020 / 0035 / 0043 / 0046 (P1)** the gates that are
  supposed to catch all of the above certify nonzero exits as clean, hard-fail on
  host variance, hardcode a stale hash, or swallow failure into exit 0.

Fixing the gates (0012/0035/0043/0046) first is high-leverage: they are why other
pipeline defects can ship undetected.

## Tier 0 -- Ship blockers (fix first)

| Rank | ID | Sev/Pri | Evidence | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | AUDIT-0037 | S1/P1 | Source proven | Linux release packaging executes an unpinned mutable download |
| 2 | AUDIT-0052 | S1/P1 | Source proven | Release assets are not bound to the verified source commit |

Both are release-integrity/supply-chain. Neither affects gameplay, but each makes
a published release untrustworthy. These gate any real publish.

## Tier 1 -- Clear before the next release candidate (P1)

In fix order. These are all S3 (except the two S1s above), and most are
runtime/fault-injected -- high confidence, and each undermines a release,
save, or automation contract.

**Release / CI gates that hide failure**
- AUDIT-0012 Sanitizer gate certifies nonzero process exits as clean
- AUDIT-0035 App shell converts engine boot failures into exit status zero
- AUDIT-0043 Auto-screenshot write failure still exits successfully

- AUDIT-0020 Guard-fire regression lane hardcodes a stale opt-out hash
- AUDIT-0013 Fidelity ledger index omits nine authoritative records
- AUDIT-0053 macOS/Linux release builds do not receive the release version
- AUDIT-0058 Linux release job succeeds without producing an AppImage
- AUDIT-0059 Linux/macOS packagers allow missing SDL runtime bundles
- AUDIT-0070 Gatekeeper rejection is nonfatal to the signing pipeline

**Save / config durability**
- AUDIT-0033 PortMaster save directory export is ignored by the shipped target
- AUDIT-0034 App-shell save overrides arrive after the save directory is frozen
- AUDIT-0054 Invalid explicit save directory is accepted as usable

**Input / launcher correctness**
- AUDIT-0060 Launcher discards interactive CLI launch flags

- AUDIT-0048 Windows diagnostics export leaks the full ROM path (privacy)
- AUDIT-0017 Four campaign routes still encode pre-FID-0117 root motion
- AUDIT-0018 Knife-impact fixture misses after the retail root-motion fix

## Tier 2 -- Correctness / robustness backlog (P2)

Grouped by theme; each is a real correctness or robustness fault, but narrower or
already contained.

**Malformed-input crashes and UB (engine/assets)**
- AUDIT-0001 OpenGL silently skips all scene-decor meshes (S2)
- AUDIT-0003 Screenshot series called OpenGL under Metal and crashed — crash
  fixed (6c1a23d); capture-composition call-site move + backend-mock
  verification remain (S2)

**Input / tape / bindings**
- AUDIT-0062 Failed input-tape finalization destroys the previous fixture
- AUDIT-0063 Input-tape playback accepts incompatible session metadata

- AUDIT-0024 Rebindable system hotkeys use impractical raw numeric sliders
- AUDIT-0025 Menu-button rebinding can create a reserved-button double role
- AUDIT-0050 Duplicate bindings trigger both actions despite last-writer message
- AUDIT-0051 Fixed alternate controls are absent from conflict detection

**Audio / diagnostics I/O**
- AUDIT-0068 Audio queue failures are counted as accepted output
- AUDIT-0069 PCM capture reports complete after a short write
- AUDIT-0067 Guard debug dump falsely confirms a truncated file
- AUDIT-0066 Guard debug dumps hard-code the POSIX /tmp directory
- AUDIT-0028 Weapon equip and reload sounds diverge from the retail tables

**Save / config**
- AUDIT-0026 Staged string settings silently truncate paths at 63 bytes

- AUDIT-0040 GLES screenshots read the stale back buffer
- AUDIT-0047 Diagnostics export ignores the resolved engine config path
- AUDIT-0010 Faithful presets retain the non-original FPS overlay
- AUDIT-0046 App smoke capture failure still exits successfully
- AUDIT-0015 Hashtable generator emits invalid output and exits zero on failure
- AUDIT-0014 Nuke cleanup quotes asset globs and leaves generated binaries

## Tier 3 -- Polish and latent (P3)

- AUDIT-0008 Vertical-only auto-aim uses uninitialized horizontal state (S3)
- AUDIT-0004 Multiplayer awards evaluate uninitialized inactive metrics (S3)
- AUDIT-0009 Low-32 pointer registry silently evicts live mappings (S3)
- AUDIT-0016 FPS-toggle help publishes the wrong SDL keycode for F10
- AUDIT-0057 Metal shadow bias copies OpenGL constants across depth formats
- AUDIT-0029 Metal half-resolution SSAO uses a non-depth-aware upsample
- AUDIT-0030 Metal texture uploads lack a discrete-GPU private-storage path
- AUDIT-0031 Metal combiner diagnostics ignore OpenGL runtime controls
- AUDIT-0021 Knife-impact help advertises the wrong default warp distance
- AUDIT-0044 Update thread creation failure never completes the UI state
- AUDIT-0032 Display frame cap is a 60 Hz alias without render interpolation

## The recent Codex batch (this session): AUDIT-0061 to AUDIT-0073

Thirteen findings, freshest and highest-confidence (all runtime/fault-injected or
directly source-proven). They cluster into three areas:

- **Input-tape robustness (0061-0065)**: late-failure false success (P1),
  fixture-destroying finalization, incompatible metadata accepted, invalid tape
  silently falling back to live input (P1), unverified allocation.
- **Diagnostics / audio I/O integrity (0066-0069)**: hardcoded /tmp, truncated
  files reported complete, audio queue/PCM failures counted as success.
- **macOS signing (0070)** and **native music subsystem (0071-0073)**: Gatekeeper
  rejection nonfatal; decompression failure ignored into the sequence parser
  (ASan crash); sequence-table over-read (ASan crash); the stale native
  mission-music initializer bypass.

0061, 0064, and 0070 are the P1 members of this batch; 0071-0073 are the
music-subsystem crashes/fidelity defect rescued from the halted run.

## Recommended fix sequence

1. **Trust the gates** -- fix the CI/exit-status swallowers first (0012, 0035,
   0043, 0046, 0015). Until these are honest, you cannot tell whether any other
   pipeline fix actually took.
2. **Release integrity** -- 0037, 0052, then 0053/0058/0059/0070.
3. **Save durability** -- 0033/0034/0054/0055/0041 (a player losing progress is
   worse than most gameplay bugs).
4. **Malformed-input crashes** -- 0005/0002/0006/0027/0042/0071/0072 (harden the
   ROM/asset trust boundary; several are one guarded branch each).
5. **The rest of P1**, then the P2 correctness backlog by theme, then P3 polish.

## Full ranked table

Ordered by the ranking method above. Within a tier (same Severity and
Priority) the order is not significant -- only the tier boundaries carry
meaning. Rank 65 in the earlier draft's duplicate has been removed; this
table is the authoritative 73-row list.
