# Native Port Audit Issues

This directory contains standalone defects found while auditing the native port.
The fidelity ledger remains authoritative for retail-versus-port parity findings;
these records cover native backend behavior, robustness, and correctness defects
that do not already have an equivalent standalone ledger entry.

For a recommended fix order across all findings, see
[PRIORITIZATION.md](PRIORITIZATION.md) (ranked by priority, severity, and
evidence, with theme clusters and a full ranked table).

## Issue Format

Every issue uses the same fields and sections:

- `Status`: lifecycle state. New reports start `Open`.
- `Severity`: user or runtime impact, independent of scheduling.
- `Priority`: recommended repair order.
- `Evidence level`: the strongest completed validation.
- `Origin`: whether this audit newly confirmed the issue or standardized a prior
  monolithic finding.
- `Affected configurations`: the configurations to which the evidence applies.
- `Summary`, `Evidence`, `Reproduction`, `Root Cause`, `Required End State`,
  `Acceptance Criteria`, `Verification Plan`, and `Related Work`.

Severity levels:

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| S1 | Broadly unusable, destructive, or security-critical. |
| S2 | Crash, major gameplay fault, or a promised feature entirely unavailable. |
| S3 | Narrow or latent correctness fault, undefined behavior, or material degradation. |
| S4 | Minor behavior, diagnostics, or maintainability problem. |

Priority levels:

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| P0 | Stop-ship; repair immediately. |
| P1 | Repair before the next release candidate. |
| P2 | Schedule in the active correctness backlog. |
| P3 | Repair after higher-risk defects or when touching the area. |

## Issue Index

All 73 audit findings, regardless of lifecycle state. Status is extracted from each issue file's `| Status |` row; the per-issue files under `issues/` remain authoritative if this column and the source ever disagree.

## Evidence Handling

ROM-derived screenshots, traces, and extracted data remain local and are not
committed. Reports retain the aggregate measurements, hashes, source anchors,
and reproduction parameters needed to repeat an observation with a legally
provided ROM. A source-only report must state when a natural gameplay trigger
has not yet been reproduced.
