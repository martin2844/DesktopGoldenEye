# AUDIT-0025: Menu-Button Rebinding Can Create a Reserved-Button Double Role

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Fixed (core; runtime-apply + UI feedback owner-verifiable) |
| Severity | S3 - a valid UI setting can conflict with gameplay and disrupt input |
| Priority | P2 |
| Area | Gamepad binding validation / overlay input |
| Evidence level | Source proven |
| Confidence | High |
| Origin | Newly confirmed by this audit |
| Affected configurations | Gamepad play after changing `Input.MenuToggleButton` |

## Summary

Gameplay capture excludes whichever gamepad button currently opens the overlay,
but changing the overlay button later does not validate existing gameplay
bindings. For example, setting Menu button to A leaves the default Jump=A
binding intact, so a single press becomes both a system-menu command and a game
action. Some choices can repeatedly gate gameplay behind the overlay.

## Evidence

[`ui_bindings.cpp`](../../../src/app/ui_bindings.cpp) excludes
`Overlay_gamepadToggleButton()` and Guide only while scanning a new gameplay
capture. Its conflict checker compares gameplay actions with one another, not
system actions.

[`input_bindings.c`](../../../src/platform/input_bindings.c) validates loaded
bindings against hardcoded Back and Guide values. It does not consult the
configured menu button. [`platform_sdl.c`](../../../src/platform/platform_sdl.c)
accepts any menu-button integer from 0 through 20 without cross-validation.

[`ui_overlay.cpp`](../../../src/app/ui_overlay.cpp) reads the configured button
for every controller event, while `gamepadBindingActive` independently reads
the same physical button for gameplay. There is no exclusive ownership layer.

## Reproduction

1. Keep the default Jump=A gameplay binding.
2. Change `Input.MenuToggleButton` from Back to A in Settings or the INI file.
3. Press A in gameplay.
4. The overlay opens even though A remains assigned to Jump; no conflict was
   shown or resolved when the system binding changed.

Equivalent conflicts can be created with other gameplay buttons, and the raw
range also includes Guide despite its existing reserved status.

## Root Cause

System bindings and gameplay bindings use separate validation domains. The
capture-time exclusion assumes the system binding is immutable and therefore
does not protect later system reconfiguration or hand-edited configuration.

## Required End State

Model overlay and OS-reserved buttons in the same conflict system as gameplay
bindings. Make a system-button change transactional: reject it with a clear
conflict, or explicitly clear/reassign the affected gameplay action with user
confirmation. Apply the same policy during configuration load.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A menu-button change cannot silently duplicate a gameplay binding.
- Guide and any other platform-reserved buttons cannot become game bindings.
- Loading a hand-edited INI applies the same dynamic reserved-button rules as
  UI capture.
- Changing the menu button updates subsequent gameplay capture exclusions.
- A rejected or cancelled change leaves every prior binding intact.
- Default Back and gameplay bindings remain unchanged.

## Verification Plan

Add a binding-model test that moves Menu from Back to A while Jump uses A,
covers reject and confirmed-reassignment policies, and repeats the matrix via
INI load. Exercise the result on a controller to verify that each accepted
physical button has exactly one owner per input context.

## Related Work

- AUDIT-0024 requires a usable capture UI for these system actions.

## Resolution

Fixed on `feat/webgpu-backend`. System bindings (the overlay/OS-reserved buttons)
and gameplay gamepad bindings live in two validation domains; `gpValid` reserved
a hardcoded Back and nothing reconciled the two, so a configured
`Input.MenuToggleButton` change (or a stock default like Jump=A once the menu
button is moved to A) could silently double-act as both the overlay toggle and a
game action.

- New pure, SDL-free predicates `src/platform/gp_reserved.{h,c}`
  (`gpButtonReserved`, `gpMenuConflict`) — SDL enum values passed in by the caller.
- `input_bindings.c` gains `gpMenuButton()` (reads `Input.MenuToggleButton` LIVE
  via `mgb_config_get_int`, default Back — the twin of `ui_overlay.cpp`'s
  `Overlay_gamepadToggleButton`), and `gpValid` now rejects the **configured**
  menu button (via `gpButtonReserved`) instead of a hardcoded Back, so an INI
  load uses the same dynamic reserved rule as capture.
- New `gamepadBindingReconcileMenu()` clears any gameplay binding whose encoded
  value equals the configured menu button (system button wins; freed action reads
  "None"), logging each cleared action. `gamepadBindingLoad()` calls it **after**
  load so both a hand-edited INI and the untouched stock defaults (which `gpValid`
  never gates) are held to the menu-wins rule.

Guarded by the ROM-free ctest `gamepad_menu_conflict`
(tests/test_gamepad_menu_conflict.c) over the pure predicates: a button equal to
the configured menu button (or Guide) is reserved; None/axis/out-of-range menu
values reserve nothing; `gpMenuConflict` flags exactly a button-encoded binding
equal to a real menu button and never an axis/None/OOB value. Full engine + app
build links; sim-neutral (host input mapping, force-defaults path untouched → 7
tapes byte-exact). The remaining acceptance items — making a *runtime* menu-button
change reconcile live and surfacing the cleared-action UI feedback — need an
interactive UI session and are left for owner verification.
