# verify_all.sh -- the S-Tier Faithfulness Program's unified verify suite (the RATCHET).
#
# Reads docs/fidelity/verify_manifest.txt (an ordered, tier-partitioned list of gate
# invocations), runs each gate under the charter-rule-6 determinism envelope, captures a
# per-gate log, and emits a machine-readable verdict:
#
#   docs/fidelity/reports/verify_<git-sha>.json
#     { sha, started, gates: [{name, cmd, status: pass|fail|skip, seconds, log}],
#       verdict: green|degraded|red, skip_count, fail_count, strict, skipped_reason? }
#
# A gate may be SKIPPED only for a missing LICENSING-BOUND prerequisite (missing-ROM /
# missing-ares) -- charter rule 9 requires every skip be listed in the report; a skip alone
# never turns the verdict red (the gate could not run, it did not fail). BUT a skip is not
# a pass either (C4, 2026-07-10 review): if every gate in the requested tier range SKIPped,
# a ROM-less/ares-less CI run has silently degraded to whatever ran (often just tier-1
# static checks) while still claiming full coverage. So the verdict has three values:
#
#   green    -- fail_count == 0 and skip_count == 0 (every gate that was supposed to run,
#               ran, and passed).
#   degraded -- fail_count == 0 but skip_count > 0 (nothing failed, but N gate(s) could not
#               run -- coverage is incomplete). Printed as "degraded: N gate(s) skipped".
#   red      -- fail_count > 0 (something actually failed).
#
# Exit code: 0 for green; 0 for degraded UNLESS GE007_VERIFY_STRICT=1 is set, in which case
# degraded exits 1 too (the release gate sets this so a ROM-less/ares-less environment can
# never rubber-stamp a release); 1 for red always, strict or not.
#
# A missing/unconfigured build/ tree (no `cmake -B build` yet) is NOT a skip class (I1,
# 2026-07-10 review, superseding an earlier draft of this file that briefly treated it as
# one): tier 1 is defined ROM-free specifically so it always runs, and unlike ROM/ares --
# licensing-bound prerequisites nobody but the owner can produce -- every runner can
# `cmake -B build` for free. So a missing build/ is a hard FAIL in ALL modes, strict or
# not (see gate_hardfail_reason below), with a one-line actionable message telling the
# runner exactly which command to run.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/fidelity/verify_all.sh [--tier N] [--manifest PATH] [--report-dir DIR]
#
#   --tier N        run tiers <= N (default: all tiers present in the manifest).
#                   The loop uses --tier 1 for inner-iteration checks; the full suite
#                   runs before committing any sim-touching change.
#
#   GE007_VERIFY_STRICT=1   (env) treat a "degraded" (skip-only) verdict as a failure --
#                   for release-oriented callers where a silent coverage drop must hard-fail
#                   instead of passing through as green/degraded-but-exit-0.
#
# The manifest is APPEND-ONLY: adding a gate = appending a line; deleting a gate requires a
# waiver ledger entry (charter rule 4 -- gates only get stricter). This script executes the
# manifest verbatim, so the manifest is the single source of truth for what "green" means.
