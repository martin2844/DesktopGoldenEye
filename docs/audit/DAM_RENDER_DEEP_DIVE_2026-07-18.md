# Dam Rendering Deep-Dive — full correctness audit (2026-07-18)

**Scope.** A read-only, evidence-first audit of the entire Dam rendering path across
the N64→host translation: endianness/pointer-width, the shared `gfx_pc.c` RDP
interpreter, the three backend emitters (WebGPU default, GL, Metal), projection /
viewport / depth, the color-combiner / blender / TMEM material machinery, room
admission, and float-contraction divergence — plus a catalog of N64 hardware
constraints that could be *released* for better-than-1:1 rendering.

**Method.** Nine parallel investigation lanes (six top-level + material sub-lanes),
each returning `file:line` evidence with an explicit confidence rating. Non-destructive
Dam captures only (audio muted, `--deterministic`); the existing `build/ge007` binary,
no rebuilds. **No code was edited in this pass** — every "fix" below is a proposal.

**Repo state.** The audit ran while a concurrent session advanced `main` from
`6834759` → `bbd3e4d` (Wave-4 perf: PERF-006 material-split, PERF-005 phase-2 pipeline
prewarm, PERF-052 audio worker, service worker). Only `gfx_pc.c` and `gfx_webgpu.c`
moved; `bg.c`, `fog.c`, `gfx_opengl.c`, `gfx_webgpu_shader.c` are unchanged. **All
line numbers below were re-anchored against current HEAD (`bbd3e4d`) for the
top-severity findings and confirmed accurate.** (Also on HEAD: the PERF-005b
present-gating fix from the earlier "portal bleed" hunt — relevant to §A.)

**How to read confidence.** `CONFIRMED` = mechanism proven in code (and, where marked,
reproduced in a capture). `PROBABLE` = mechanism proven, visible impact inferred.
`HYPOTHESIS` = plausible, not yet decisively shown. Per repo doctrine, any "is-this-
faithful?" question that needs the real console is marked **stock-verdict-pending** —
those require a stock-N64 (ares) capture before any change ships.

## Implementation status (2026-07-18, same-day execution session)

Every actionable finding was either landed, refuted, or deferred-with-evidence:

| finding | status | commit / note |
|---|---|---|
| DAM-R1a (native over-bright) | **REFUTED / closed** | camera phase-skew, not shading (`d0d6152`) |
| DAM-R1b (sRGB surface) | **REFUTED** | enum-namespace confusion — web fmt 23 = Dawn BGRA8Unorm (linear); full fix implemented → 0 web effect → reverted (`bb4a824`). Residual ~10-lvl CDP-capture artifact, not a render bug. **Fully closed 2026-07-20 (Task 6): sky hue refuted (36-sample locus); compositor path faithful on the ONE captured pose (both retries black — single-pose evidence, +1.6-lvl gun ROI residual not isolated; see §Task 6 caveats)** |
| BLEND-1 (coverage-alpha writeMask) | **LANDED** | `d10866a` — cvg pixels now match GL (26→≤3), non-cvg byte-identical |
| AC-3 (G_AC_DITHER dissolve) | **LANDED** | `f1cc65f` — WGSL now emits the dissolve like GL/Metal |
| DAM-R1c (room_water_alpha_suppress) | **LANDED** | `f1cc65f` — ported to WGSL |
| TMEM-2 (settex cache key) | **LANDED** | `37dd559` — palette-identity key, byte-identical |
| R1 (FogDensity remaster default) | **LANDED** | `262c4cf` — 0.6 in remaster preset, faithful pinned 1.0 |
| R5 (SmoothSky) | **LANDED** | `262c4cf` — opt-in; NO-OP on Dam (audit premise corrected), real effect on gradient skies |
| TMEM-4 / TMEM-3 / PVD-001 | **latent hardening** | defensive, byte-identical (this session) |
| TMEM-1 (format reinterpretation) | **RESOLVED — NO DEFECT (2026-07-19 census)** | census at the texSelect choke point: reinterpretation is a phantom. `texSelect` (retail 0x7F076D68) selects `format = tex->gbiformat` (pool) over `tconfig->format` (table) whenever the texture is pooled — RDP-definitional, retail-identical. The table's differing fmt is discarded metadata, NOT honored on hardware. Class (b) live-divergence = EMPTY; see §TMEM-1 census. |
| DAM-R2 (R-01/R-02 authored PVS) | **LANDED (2026-07-19), Dam-scoped** | stock draws the shore (Task 0); camera AIM admits the far rooms (force-admit proves the far rooms are frustum-visible at the as-is native cam — the "pitch divergence" was bare-sky filling the missing far geometry). FOV/framing residual (mountains smaller/lower): `CutsceneFovY`=60 **ADJUDICATED retail-faithful (Task 5, 2026-07-20)** — asm (no FOV field in `SetupIntroCamera`; base `fovy`=60) + geometry agree. **Task 5b (2026-07-20) re-ran the geometric leg on properly registered frames** (Task 5 compared a 16:9 native capture with a 4:3 stock frame, unregistered): stock→native fits the **identity** (sy=sx=1.000, corr 0.683) → **FOV_y = 60.0 ± 0.25°**, confirming the conclusion on corrected numbers, and the reported "native 75px vs retail 20px cinematic band" is a **capture artifact** (fixed-640×480 screenshot canvas letterboxing the default 16:9 window — a 4:3 window reproduces stock's 20/20 exactly; FID-0135). Most of the originally-reported "mountains smaller/lower" reading was itself the FID-0135 capture-aspect squeeze, not rendered geometry; the small residual that survives registration is DAM-R2 admitting a **different** far-room set than retail's authored PVS — not merely a superset, and the surviving direction is now suspected **over**-admission (native draws far shore/bridge geometry stock omits, at x≈430/540) rather than the original under-admission premise (→ **FID-0137**, R-02 deferred), see below. Fixed by admitting frustum-visible far rooms **draw-only** during `playerHasFrozenIntroCamera`, gated to `g_CurrentStageToLoad == LEVELID_DAM` (`bg.c`, reproduce-then-restore; opt-out `GE007_NO_INTRO_FARVISTA_ADMIT`) — over-admission safety was validated on Dam only, so other levels' frozen intros are candidates pending their own stock-ares adjudication (R-01 below). R-02 (revive `sub_GAME_7F0B38B4`) NOT taken: no live caller + vis-list data source absent from decomp. |
| R3 (Anisotropy) | **DEFERRED (evidence)** | entangled with the WGSL 3-point filter (forces NEAREST sampler); needs FILT-1 rework + a mip chain |
| FILT-1, FMA-1, FMA-2, EN-1, AC-1 | **open** | FILT-1 needs a filter-scale uniform; FMA-1/2 shift the baseline (re-record decision); EN-1 no live trigger; AC-1 latent (GE doesn't emit G_AC_THRESHOLD) |

The one blocking dependency for the deferred faithfulness items remains a **stock-N64
(ares) Dam capture set** (§G) — run the ares binary alone. PERF-013/014/015/016
audited clean; the perf program (Wave 4) is separately complete.

## ⚠️ CORRECTION 2026-07-18 (post-audit, implementation session): DAM-R1b REFUTED — enum-namespace confusion

**DAM-R1b (the "sRGB surface double-encode", ranked #1 below) is WRONG and has been
experimentally refuted.** The finding rests on reading the web console's `surface
format=23` in **wgpu-native's** `WGPUTextureFormat` enum (where `23 = 0x17 =
RGBA8UnormSrgb`). But the web build links **emdawnwebgpu (Dawn)**, whose enum numbers
the same formats differently: `BGRA8Unorm = 0x17 = 23`, `RGBA8UnormSrgb = 0x13 = 19`.
So the browser's `format=23` is **Dawn `BGRA8Unorm` — LINEAR**, the *same kind* of
format as native's `format=27` (wgpu-native `BGRA8Unorm = 0x1B = 27`). Native and web
both render into a linear BGRA8 surface; there is **no sRGB attachment and no
gamma-encode-on-store** anywhere. The "23 vs 27" the audit cited is just the two
libraries' different integer for the identical format.

**Experimental proof (this session):** implemented the proposed fix in full — a
non-sRGB `s_scene_format` for the scene target + all render pipelines + a non-sRGB
present-copy view + surface `viewFormats` (native byte-identical, parity gate green) —
and it changed the web output by **0** (Dam sky `(65,90,130)` before vs `(68,93,131)`
after; ground unchanged). Then forced the *surface* itself non-sRGB via
`wgpu_choose_format` — also 0 effect (both are already `BGRA8Unorm`, so
`wgpu_nonsrgb_format` is correctly identity). Both experiments reverted.

**Status of the residual over-bright:** the ~7-11 level/channel web-vs-native lift I
measured on the *3D scene* (and the audit's ~20 on the sky) is real in the CDP
screenshot but is **NOT an sRGB encode** — mechanism unknown. Leading remaining
hypotheses: (a) a CDP `Page.captureScreenshot` / canvas color-management artifact that
is not what a human viewer sees (the 2D gun-barrel blood overlay pixel-MATCHES native
at (147,·,·), suggesting 2D content is faithful); (b) a genuine but subtle
Dawn-vs-wgpu-native 3D fog/lighting difference. Distinguishing needs the *actual
rendered canvas* compared to native by eye, not a CDP capture. **Do not ship the sRGB
fix.** DAM-R1a (native reproduces nothing) still stands; DAM-R1 overall remains
"native = clean; web = a small unexplained 3D-scene lift, non-sRGB."

**Lesson:** never interpret a raw WebGPU enum integer without pinning the enum's
library namespace — wgpu-native and Dawn disagree on `WGPUTextureFormat` values.

### ⚠️ CLOSURE 2026-07-20 (Task 4, **corrected 2026-07-21 — see Fix round 1 note below**): opaque 3D surfaces show no over-bright; CDP is faithful to the GPU buffer; compositor path unverified (FID-0134)

The "residual over-bright" left open above (hypotheses (a) CDP capture artifact vs
(b) genuine Dawn-vs-wgpu-native 3D divergence) was narrowed with a same-frame,
four-way readback discriminator, restricted to what it actually proves: on the
**opaque 3D surfaces** (rock/ground/viewmodel) there is **no systematic lift at HEAD
(`3f376bb`)**, and up through the GPU swapchain buffer the CDP screenshot is
byte-faithful to the engine's own readback. This does **not** verify the
canvas/compositor/display color-management path a human viewer actually sees (see
"Verified scope" below) — that step remains open. Method: read the SAME dam
`--deterministic` web frame three ways — (2) CDP `Page.captureScreenshot`; (i-scene)
`GE007_WEBGPU_DUMP_FRAME` → the offscreen scene target GPU-buffer readback
(pre-present); (i-surface) `GE007_WEBGPU_DUMP_SURFACE` → the post-present-copy
GPU-buffer readback — the two dumps **bypass the canvas colorspace, the compositor
and the CDP encode entirely**. CDP is captured the instant the MEMFS dump file
appears, so all three web reads share one camera pose. Baseline: `build/ge007 …
--level dam --deterministic --screenshot-frame N` (wgpu-native).

**Method-reliability caveat (added Fix round 1):** of the three independent web runs
behind this closure, one (run 1 of 3) shows the poll-for-dump→CDP-screenshot
synchronization race failing — CDP sky `[36.4,64.7,105.1]` vs GPU-dump sky
`[72.6,92.9,124.6]`, full-image mean-abs-diff R 3.31 / G 2.95 / B 2.48 (vs the ≤0.53
of the clean run used for the table below). Even in that failed run, the
frame-invariant rock/ground ROIs stayed **byte-identical** CDP-vs-dump, so the
failure is temporal (CDP and dump landed on different frames), not colorimetric —
the "CDP is faithful to the buffer it captures" conclusion survives, but the
capture harness is not perfectly reliable and a future re-run should confirm frame
identity before trusting a single sample.

| ROI (frame-matched: native f300 / web f500) | native (wgpu-native) | web CDP (2) | web GPU-dump surface (i) | web GPU-dump scene (i) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| sky *(pose-sensitive, see below)* | 62.1, 72.1, 88.6 | 36.5, 64.7, 105.1 | 36.4, 64.7, 105.0 | 36.4, 64.7, 105.0 |
| rock (3D terrain, frame-invariant) | 32.0, 32.6, 34.3 | 30.9, 31.5, 33.2 | 30.9, 31.5, 33.2 | 30.9, 31.5, 33.2 |
| ground (3D terrain, frame-invariant) | 77.9, 79.2, 83.3 | 78.5, 79.8, 83.9 | 78.5, 79.8, 83.9 | 78.5, 79.8, 83.9 |
| gun/viewmodel (2D-ish overlay control) | 63.2, 64.3, 67.5 | 61.3, 62.3, 65.5 | 60.5, 61.5, 64.6 | 60.5, 61.5, 64.6 |

- **CDP is faithful to the GPU buffer it captures (hypothesis (a) FALSE, scope: up to
  the swapchain).** Full-image mean-abs-diff between the CDP screenshot and the
  GPU-buffer readback on the clean run (tight pose alignment) is **R 0.53 / G 0.50 /
  B 0.49**, and the frame-invariant rock/ground ROIs are **byte-identical** between CDP
  and both dumps. `Page.captureScreenshot` adds no brightness relative to the buffer it
  reads — but this proves nothing about the canvas/compositor/display path downstream
  of that buffer (see "Verified scope" below).
- **No systematic over-bright on opaque 3D surfaces (hypothesis (b) FALSE for a
  lift).** On the frame-invariant opaque surfaces, web-vs-native is **≤2–3 levels and
  goes BOTH directions** (rock web ~1 *darker*, ground web +0.6, viewmodel ~2 darker).
  This is ordinary FILT-1 / sort-epsilon noise, not a lift.
- **CORRECTED (Fix round 1): the prior ~7–11 (scene) / ~20 (sky) "lift" was a
  cross-frame sky-comparison artifact — but the mechanism is a time-varying sky, NOT
  camera drift.** The original text here claimed the idle camera was drifting and
  sweeping the rock silhouette across the sky ROI, and cited sky means of
  `f120 [60.9,89.0,130.5]`, `f200 [34.4,68.4,116.5]`, `f350 [78.4,103.0,140.3]`. Neither
  claim survives re-derivation from the preserved capture bitmaps (`roi.mjs` re-run
  2026-07-21): **the camera is static** — `rock` and `ground` are byte-identical
  frame-for-frame across the whole f120→f350 sweep (`[32.0,32.6,34.3]` /
  `[77.9,79.2,83.3]`, no variation at all), which is inconsistent with any camera
  motion, drifting or otherwise. What actually varies is the **sky itself**, which
  climbs monotonically at this fixed camera: `f120 [39.2,54.3,76.4]` → `f200
  [46.8,60.1,80.3]` → `f250 [56.9,68.0,85.7]` → `f300 [62.1,72.1,88.6]` → `f350
  [72.1,80.3,94.5]` — roughly +18 to +33 levels/channel over 230 frames with zero
  input. That is a **time-varying / animated sky parameter** (e.g. a procedural sky
  gradient or day-cycle term driven by frame count), not a pose artifact. It still
  invalidates the original cross-frame native-vs-web sky comparison — a sky ROI read
  at mismatched frame numbers is not comparable regardless of camera pose — so the
  narrower, correct reason the historical sky-lift measurement was unreliable is
  **time-varying sky at a fixed camera**, and the "idle camera drift / pose sweep"
  story in the original closure text is retracted.
- **`surface` dump == `scene` dump byte-for-byte**, independently confirming the
  present-copy blit is a pure linear copy (no sRGB re-encode-on-store), corroborating
  the CORRECTION above and the reverted `bb4a824`.
- **Second pose (frame 250) note (Fix round 1):** CDP-vs-dump sky at this pose differs
  by ~2–3 levels (`[61.9,84.4,118.6]` vs `[64.5,86.4,120.0]`) — small but non-zero,
  unlike the near-exact match at the primary pose (frame 500, ≤0.4 level). Noted here
  rather than folded into a blanket "CDP == dump"; rock/ground stay byte-identical at
  this pose too.
- **Residual note (minor, left open):** the one real native-vs-web difference is a
  small sky *hue* shift — web renders a slightly more saturated blue (bluer, **not
  brighter**). It is real-in-bytes (CDP == dump) but pose-confounded and is **not** the
  over-bright symptom; it is plausibly the known WebGPU sky-backdrop blend behavior
  (BLEND-1 / FMA-2), which is present on wgpu-native too. Not pursued here.

**Verified scope (narrowed, Fix round 1).** What this closure actually establishes:
no systematic over-bright on opaque 3D surfaces at native/web parity, up through the
GPU swapchain buffer; CDP is faithful to that buffer; and the historical sky-lift
measurements are invalidated by a time-varying sky term, not a capture defect. What
it does **not** establish: the canvas-compositor-to-display color-management path a
human actually sees was **not verified** — path (ii) `getImageData` was blank in
headless (see below), so a real color-management issue between the GPU buffer and
the pixels a browser paints on screen cannot be ruled out. The headline is **"no
systematic over-bright on opaque 3D surfaces; historical sky-lift measurements
invalidated by a time-varying sky; compositor-path verification remains open,"** not
an unqualified "no real divergence."

Ledger: **FID-0134 (refuted, scope narrowed)**. Full harness (`webprobe.mjs`), commands
and images: Task-4 report (`.superpowers/sdd/task-4-report.md`, "Fix round 1 —
corrected evidence" section). Path (ii) canvas `drawImage`→`getImageData` readback
returned blank in headless (the WebGPU canvas is not `drawImage`-able outside its rAF
frame); it is superseded by the two engine GPU-buffer dumps for the opaque-surface
question, but it means the compositor/canvas leg of the pipeline was never actually
exercised — that gap is still open, not closed.

### ✅ CLOSURE round 2 — 2026-07-20 (Task 6): both residuals closed at matched geometry (FID-0134, FID-0138, FID-0139)

The two gaps left open above — **(a)** the unverified compositor path and **(b)** the
sky hue shift — are now measured and both close **negative**. Neither required an
engine change.

**(a) Compositor path — CLOSED, clean, n=1 pose.** Headful Chrome, canvas pinned to a
640×480 backing store, the engine's own GPU surface dump of frame 600, and the rAF pump
frozen on dump detection so the presented frame stops advancing (freeze verified: two
`screencapture`s 1.2 s apart are **byte-identical** — this proves *temporal* stability of
that one captured frame, not pose coverage). The visible window was captured
with macOS `screencapture` — the true compositor/display path — and 2×2 box-downsampled
to the buffer's native resolution:

| ROI | Δ RGB vs GPU buffer (P3→sRGB corrected) | Δhue |
|---|---|---|
| rock | +0.27, +0.16, +0.03 | — (s≈0.06, ill-conditioned) |
| ground | +0.38, +0.11, −0.17 | — |
| sky | +2.18, +1.48, +0.51 | **+0.05°** |
| skyhi | +1.52, +1.09, +0.28 | **−0.07°** |
| gun | +1.63, +1.43, +1.31 | — (s≈0.06, ill-conditioned) |

Rock/ground agree to ≤0.4 levels; sky/skyhi to ≤2.2 levels with hue within 0.1°.
**gun is +1.6 levels and is not folded into "opaque surfaces" above** — it is not isolated,
and the suspected cause is the 2×2 box-downsample alignment (`ox=0, oy=1`) landing badly
on the gun's high-frequency viewmodel content, not a render divergence. Note the FID-0138
P3-encode explanation that accounts for the sky's raw-vs-corrected hue shift does **not**
extend to gun's residual: unlike residual (b)'s phase artifact, (a) compares the *same*
frozen frame on both sides, so there is no phase difference for a (b)-style aliasing
mechanism to act on. **The compositor/canvas/display path adds no brightness or hue
divergence on rock/ground/sky; the gun ROI is a reported, unresolved residual.**

**Disclosure (n=1):** this verdict rests on **ONE** captured pose (frame 600). Two
further attempts (frames 400, 800) produced valid engine GPU dumps but the
`screencapture` came back **black** both times — the display slept and then the session
locked mid-session, and `caffeinate -dis` did not survive the lock, so a second pose was
never obtained. The byte-identity freeze-check above demonstrates the one captured frame
was stable while held, not that the result generalizes across poses.

⚠️ **The trap this uncovered (FID-0138):** read *raw*, the same capture shows a
**+3.0°/+3.6° sky hue shift with R up 6–8 levels**, while neutral surfaces are
untouched. `screencapture` tags its output **Display P3**, not sRGB (`sips -g profile`
confirms), and an sRGB→P3 encode moves only saturated colours. After
`sips --matchTo 'sRGB Profile.icc'` the hue error collapses to +0.05°/−0.07°. Any
harness comparing raw `screencapture` bytes to an engine buffer will manufacture a
false "the web renders bluer" result. This is the colour-space sibling of FID-0135's
geometry confound.

**(b) Sky hue — REFUTED.** Root cause of the time-varying sky is
`g_SkyCloudOffset += g_ClockTimer` (`src/game/player.c:272-278`), a scrolling cloud
texcoord consumed at `player.c:486-656`, wrapping at 4096 and never reset — so it is
driven by the **level-local clock**, and `--screenshot-game-timer` (not
`--screenshot-frame`) is the correct pin. Across a 36-sample native curve at pinned 4:3
640×480 / RenderScale 1 over game timers 150–1400, the sky **hue spans only
215.21–217.89° (2.68°) while saturation spans 0.29–0.70** — hue is phase-robust,
saturation is not. Three web GPU dumps located on that curve by least squares over two
sky ROIs:

| web dump | best-fit native timer | joint rms | Δhue (sky / skyhi) | nearest rival |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| frame 400 | 234 | 0.175 lvl | +0.028° / +0.014° | 154 (rms 2.36) |
| frame 600 | 1039 | **0.016 lvl** | +0.000° / −0.003° | 1119 (rms 4.54) |
| frame 800 | 471 | **0.007 lvl** | +0.000° / −0.008° | 1308 (rms 6.18) |

Frame-invariant terrain controls agree independently in all three: rock
[−0.02,−0.02,−0.02], ground [0.00,0.00,0.00]. **The web sky lies exactly on the native
locus.** The "web renders a more saturated blue" residual was a *phase* artifact and is
retracted.

**Geometry audit of Task 4's own numbers (FID-0135 applied retroactively).** Task 4's
preserved native captures measure 640×480 with 75px bars → content aspect **1.939**
(the default 16:9 window squeezed into the fixed screenshot canvas); its web captures
are 640×393 with 16/15px bars → aspect **1.768**. A **9.7% aspect mismatch**, with
hand-placed whole-image-fraction ROIs in two different framings. The web side has its
own analogue: the canvas is `width:100vw;height:100vh` with **no aspect fit**, so it
inherits the browser viewport's aspect. Cost, measured at a *fixed* game timer 300 by
changing only the native window aspect: the sky ROI moves **+31.8/+33.2/+37.1 levels**
(16:9 → 4:3) — the same order as the ~20-level "sky lift" under investigation. Terrain
is far less affected (≤1.5 levels), which is why Task 4's terrain conclusion survived
while its sky numbers did not.

**Task 4's parity numbers are therefore corrected** — conclusion unchanged, evidence
~100× tighter:

| ROI | Task 4 reported | Task 6 at matched geometry |
|---|---|---|
| rock | web ~1 level darker | **−0.02** |
| ground | +0.6 | **+0.00** |
| claim | "≤2–3 lvl, both directions" | **≤0.02 lvl** |

`Video.RenderScale` (native 2 vs web 1) was checked and is **not** a confound (≤0.2 lvl).

**Instrumentation gaps found (FID-0139).** The web build **cannot** write the standard
fidelity screenshot — `platformSaveScreenshot` → `gfx_backend_read_framebuffer_rgb`
needs a synchronous GPU map whose callback only fires during `ProcessEvents`, so it
fails closed (`[gfx] screenshot readback failed`); web capture must use
`GE007_WEBGPU_DUMP_*`. And the render-frame ordinal does **not** track the sim clock
(`g_ClockTimer` is 0–4 ticks per rendered frame): across three runs of the same build,
frame 400/600/800 mapped to timers 234/1039/471, non-monotonic. **Task 4's assumed fixed
"+200" native/web frame offset is therefore invalid and is retracted** — frame ordinals
cannot pin a web capture at all, which is why Task 6 used locus matching instead.

Ledger: **FID-0134 (refuted, both residuals now closed)**, **FID-0138** (screencapture
Display P3 confound), **FID-0139** (web capture/pinning gaps). Harness and full numeric
tables: `.superpowers/sdd/task-6-report.md`, `.superpowers/sdd/task-6-harness/`.

## Executive summary — ranked findings

| # | id | area | sev | conf | backends | one-liner |
|---|-----|------|-----|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **DAM-R1b** | sky/surface | ~~P1~~→**REFUTED/CLOSED (scope narrowed)** | REFUTED (2026-07-20, corrected 2026-07-21, FID-0134) | web only | ~~Browser scene target is sRGB → over-bright.~~ Superseded by the CORRECTION (linear BGRA8, not sRGB). A same-frame four-way readback shows CDP is byte-faithful to the GPU readback it captures (mean <0.53/ch) and opaque 3D surfaces are at native parity (≤2–3 lvl, both directions). The prior sky "lift" was a cross-frame comparison artifact caused by a **time-varying sky at a static camera** (not camera drift, corrected Fix round 1). **CLOSURE round 2 (2026-07-20, Task 6): both residuals now CLOSED (n=1 compositor pose; gun ROI not isolated — see full §CLOSURE round 2 (a) above).** The compositor/display path a human actually sees was measured (headful capture vs GPU buffer at one frozen frame) and is faithful on rock/ground/sky — ≤0.4 lvl / ≤2.2 lvl, hue within 0.1° — with a +1.6 lvl gun residual reported, not folded in. The sky hue shift is REFUTED: at matched geometry and matched phase the web sky lies on the native locus (rms 0.007–0.175 lvl, Δhue ≤0.028°). Task 4's own parity numbers carried a 9.7% aspect confound (FID-0135) and are corrected to ≤0.02 lvl. See CLOSURE round 2 above; FID-0138/FID-0139. |

**CORRECTION (2026-07-19, Task 1b — FID-0132):** the companion "monitor floor-level
detachment" symptom (the prior "pad-spawned single monitors render only the screen
sub-DL; the **CRT body never draws** / opcode-0x12 switch" hypothesis carried in
DAM_PARITY §4.7) is **REFUTED**. The CRT body draws; the monitors were mis-**placed**,
not mis-drawn. Root cause is a **sim** defect, not a render defect: the NONMATCHING
collision-hull builder `sub_GAME_7F03ECC0` emitted a degenerate footprint for the
near-axis-aligned desk collision boxes (the FID-0096 `hullVertexCount` clamp-to-4
dropped real hull corners → point-in-polygon triangle → desk-detection miss →
floor-snap at `runtime_pos.y=−618.71` vs the desk `−525.31`). Fixed by unclamping
the collision_data-backed path (retail-faithful); 4/4 hut monitors now seat on
desks, both backends; Dam degenerate-hull census 31→0 spurious (40 degenerate
total pre-fix, 9 inherent/collinear and unfixable by design). **TMEM-1 (monitor flat-green
*text*, row 2) is a distinct, still-open texture defect** and is unaffected.

Lower-severity / by-design items (AC-2/4/5, BLEND-3/4/5, FILT-3/4/5, TMEM-5, FMA-3/4,
PVD-003, R-03/04/05) are detailed in their sections. **Beyond-1:1 constraint-release
catalog (R1–R10)** is §F.

---

## A. The DAM-R1 reframe (flagship)

The long-standing top post-release item — an "over-bright rectangular sky/backdrop
seam on Dam, WebGPU-only" — **splits into three distinct facts**, two of which
overturn the prior ledger.

### DAM-R1a — the standing native P1 does NOT reproduce — CONFIRMED (refutes a P1)
On **native** WebGPU vs GL, stationary Dam backdrop / distant-mountain / water pixels
are byte-identical to ±1 LSB (pad-70: mountain WG `[24.4,54.2,97.5]` vs GL
`[24.2,54.0,97.3]`; water WG `[14.5,41.1,61.0]` vs GL `[14.6,41.3,61.2]`). The large
frame-190 divergence the predecessor hunt measured is the **intro swirl animating** —
a sub-frame phase difference between the two backend runs lights every silhouette
edge, and the divergent pixels go *both* directions (brighter and darker), which a
one-directional shading bug cannot produce. Native surface format is `27 = BGRA8Unorm`
(linear), so there is no gamma step to diverge from GL. **Action: close the native
DAM-R1 as not-a-defect / camera-timing artifact; the 634525d "WGSL-vs-GLSL shading"
reframe was chasing a ghost on native.**

### DAM-R1b — WEB build sRGB surface double-encodes the scene — **P1 (web-only)**, PROBABLE
The genuine over-bright is browser-only. `wgpu_choose_format` (`gfx_webgpu.c:461`) takes
`caps.formats[0]` **unconditionally** on web (the WEB-049 "prefer first" path); on a
browser that first format is **`23 = RGBA8UnormSrgb`** — an sRGB format. The offscreen
scene target adopts `s_surface_format` (`gfx_webgpu.c:955`, `:982`, `:3000`: *"must match
the scene for T2T copy"*), so the WGSL combiner's raw N64 output — values authored in
the display domain, exactly as GL writes them to its **linear** default framebuffer —
is written into an sRGB attachment and **gamma-encoded on store**. That lifts darks,
turning the dim-blue horizon backdrop bright. GL never encodes, so it stays faithful;
the defect is WebGPU-only because only the web surface is sRGB. `wgpu_format_is_bgra`
(`gfx_webgpu.c:574`) treats the sRGB and non-sRGB BGRA variants identically — no code
path strips the sRGB variant.

- **Independent confirmation (this audit, main agent):** the surface-format asymmetry
  is real — the browser console logs `[webgpu] backend initialized (surface format=23)`
  (sRGB) while native logs `27` (linear). A same-backend A/B (browser vs native
  WebGPU, differing *only* by surface format) at the Dam spawn sky shows the browser
  patch **~20 levels/channel brighter** (`[32,33,35]` vs native `[12,13,15]`) — the
  direction DAM-R1b predicts.
- **Caveat (do not over-claim):** the observed lift is *milder* than a clean single
  linear→sRGB store-encode would produce (a full encode of `(15,30,52)` → ~`(69,113,151)`,
  but the ledger/observed value is ~`(19,50,98)`). So the exact gamma path (partial
  encode, copy-only, or a blend interaction) is not yet pinned. Hence **PROBABLE**, not
  CONFIRMED.
- **Proposed fix (exact, web-only):** decouple the scene byte-path from the sRGB
  surface. Add `s_scene_format` = the non-sRGB pair of `s_surface_format` (23→22, 28→27,
  else identity); render the offscreen scene target and all 3D color targets in it;
  declare that format in the surface `viewFormats` and create the present-copy surface
  view with `format = s_scene_format` (a legal non-sRGB view of the sRGB swapchain).
  The blit then moves bytes verbatim, matching GL. *Rejected weaker alt:* scanning for a
  non-sRGB format in `wgpu_choose_format` — browsers routinely advertise **only** the
  sRGB canvas format, so the view-override is the robust path.
- **Regression risk:** Low. Native is already linear (`s_scene_format == s_surface_format`,
  identity); the combiner/fog WGSL is untouched, so native baselines stay byte-identical.
  Risk surface is web-only present-copy `viewFormats` validation.
- **Promotion experiment (PROBABLE→CONFIRMED):** log `caps.formats[0]` on the web build,
  confirm it is 23, and verify a non-sRGB scene target drops the backdrop from ~`(19,50,98)`
  to GL's ~`(15,30,52)`.

> PERF-005 async-pipeline draw drops, already root-caused and fixed (PERF-005b
> present-gating, now on HEAD). DAM-R1b (over-bright backdrop) is a separate web defect
> that would have compounded the visual. They are independent.

### DAM-R1c — WGSL combiner emitter is a partial port — P3, CONFIRMED (not the Dam cause)
`gfx_webgpu_shader.c` omits several post-combiner fragment effects GL/Metal emit. Most
are diag-gated/default-off, but `room_water_alpha_suppress` is not: GL/Metal force the
shell alpha to 0 (`gfx_opengl.c:1360`, `gfx_metal.mm:639`), WGSL never references it, so
on WebGPU a suppressed shell renders at authored alpha. The predicate is **Frigate**-
specific (`settex_texturenum==655`), not Dam, and sky-tris are excluded from the class
(`gfx_pc.c:5683` returns `"sky"`), consistent with the sub-LSB native Dam match. Also
WGSL-absent: the `opt_noise` final-alpha gate (see **AC-3**, same root), `diag_*` scales,
`opt_dfdx_light` relight. **Fix:** port `room_water_alpha_suppress` + the noise gate into
the WGSL emitter after the combiner clamp. Risk very low.

**Cross-lane reconciliation.** Two other lanes independently touched DAM-R1 and were
*superseded* by the dedicated lane: the blender lane guessed the seam was the WebGPU
viewport/scissor clamp — but the projection lane proved viewport/scissor has a unique
`dx=0, dy=0` shift minimum (no offset), and DAM-R1a proves native reproduces nothing.
The FMA lane cited a stale doc ("Y-flip edge-ownership"), already refuted in the
`634525d` ledger. **DAM-R1b (sRGB) is the authoritative mechanism.**

---

## B. Confirmed correctness defects

### TMEM-1 — format reinterpretation dropped on the G_SETTEX path — **P1**, CONFIRMED (code-verified by main agent)
The "monitor flat-green" class is **not** generalized-fixed. On the texture-by-number
path, `gfx_handle_settex` decodes strictly by the pool's catalogued format —
`fmt = tex->gbiformat; sz = tex->depth` (`gfx_pc.c:22616-22617`, **verified at HEAD**) —
and passes those to the decoder; the DL's `G_SETTILE` tile format is used only for tile
*config* (wrap/mask/shift), never for decode. So a `texSelect` that re-tiles a
CI4-catalogued texture through an I8 tile (raw-TMEM-bytes reinterpretation, e.g.
`IMAGE_MONITOR_TEXT`) is still decoded as CI4 → flat green. Reinterpretation *is*
honored on the traditional LOADBLOCK/LOADTILE path (`import_texture` reads fmt/siz from
`rdp.texture_tile[tile_desc]`, the real G_SETTILE) — the gap is specific to the settex
path GE monitor/texSelect materials use. The only related fix (`fb59c95`,
`gfx_palette_entry_to_rgba32`) corrected the IA16 TLUT **byte order** — a different half
of the monitor defect. **This contradicts the "GENERALIZED" claim in the prior DAM
parity deep-dive note — flagged as a discrepancy to resolve; the code shows the
reinterpretation half is still open.**
- **Fix:** when the settex `G_SETTILE` fmt/siz disagree with `tex->gbiformat/depth`,
  decode by the *tile* fmt over the raw `tex->data` bytes (or pre-decode dual-format
  variants). Requires TMEM-2 first.
- **Risk:** Medium (depends on the cache key fix).

> **UPDATE 2026-07-18 (implementation): TMEM-2 LANDED (`37dd559`), TMEM-1 DEFERRED with evidence.**
> TMEM-2 shipped byte-identically (palette-identity key + `settex_cache_key.h` predicate

### TMEM-2 — `settex_cache` keyed on `texturenum` alone — P2, CONFIRMED (verified at HEAD)
The lookup matches `settex_cache[i].texturenum == texturenum` (`gfx_pc.c:22571`,
**verified**) with no fmt/siz/palette component, so the same texturenum through two tile
formats or two TLUTs returns the first decode. This is the structural blocker for
TMEM-1. **Fix:** add tile fmt/siz (+ CI palette identity) to the settex key. Risk low-med.

### BLEND-1 — WebGPU never preserves the coverage-alpha channel — P2, CONFIRMED
The RDP-CVG-memory path stores a synthetic 3-bit coverage in the scene-target **alpha**
and a later draw reads it back to emulate N64 `CVG_DST_WRAP`. GL masks alpha off for
interleaving normal XLU draws (`gfx_opengl.c:1905`, `glColorMask(T,T,T,FALSE)` under the
cvg-memory predicate); Metal mirrors it (`s_preserve_cov_alpha`, `gfx_metal.mm:3368`).
WebGPU **hard-codes `writeMask = All`** (`gfx_webgpu.c:2079`, **verified at HEAD**) with
no gate, so any ordinary alpha/modulate draw between two CVG-memory draws clobbers the
stored coverage. The path is a live default (room-cvg-memory defaults on; Dam has fogged
secondary-room backdrop strips). Contra the stale comment at `gfx_webgpu.c:2006`, the
path *is* ported. **Fix:** gate the WebGPU `writeMask` to RGB-only under the same
predicate, threading a preserve flag into the pipeline key (currently blend|depth|decal
only). **Risk medium** (adds a PSO variant; keep GL byte-identical).

### AC-3 — WGSL omits the `G_AC_DITHER` alpha-dissolve — P2, CONFIRMED
`use_noise` (`gfx_pc.c:17959`, **verified**) → `SHADER_OPT_NOISE`. GL and Metal seed
`needs_noise = cc.opt_noise` and emit the dissolve (`gfx_opengl.c:1337`,
`gfx_metal.mm:628`); **WGSL seeds `needs_noise = false`** (`gfx_webgpu_shader.c:307`,
**verified**) and has no alpha-dither line. The default/shipping backend silently drops
the stochastic ~50% dissolve on PCL_SURF particle/dissolve modes (watch-menu fade
`watch.c:2873`, BG particle LUT `bg.c:3247`). **Fix:** seed `needs_noise` with
`cc.opt_noise` and emit the alpha-multiply after the texture-edge block using the
existing noise uniform. Risk low (additive, gated). *Sub-note:* the upstream `alpha *=
floor(random+0.5)` form kills ~50% independent of alpha vs N64's alpha-vs-random compare
— a faithfulness approximation present on GL/Metal, absent on WebGPU.

### AC-1 — `G_AC_THRESHOLD` never decoded; blend-color register dropped — P2, CONFIRMED(mech)
The interpreter decodes only `G_AC_DITHER` (bits==3, `gfx_pc.c:17959`); there is **no**
`== G_AC_THRESHOLD` (bits==1) branch anywhere, and `G_SETBLENDCOLOR` (0xF9) is a no-op in
both interpreters (`gfx_pc.c:23917`, `:24959`, **verified**), so `rdp.blend_color` — the
threshold comparand — is never captured. A threshold path is unimplementable today. GE
uses `G_AC_NONE`/`G_AC_DITHER` and no explicit `G_AC_THRESHOLD` was found (search not
exhaustive → latent, not a visible Dam regression; Dam alpha-kill runs through the
texture-edge 0.19 path instead). **Fix:** capture `rdp.blend_color` in the 0xF9 handler;
decode `(other_mode_l & 3) == 1` into a shader option; emit `if (a < uBlendColor.a)
discard`. Risk low (gated on the exact bit pattern).

### FILT-1 — WGSL lacks the magnification nearest-fast-path — P2, CONFIRMED
GL/Metal wrap the N64 3-point in `if (footprint < nearest_threshold) return nearest(...)`
(`gfx_opengl.c:1119`, `gfx_metal.mm:351`); WGSL's `n64Filter3` has no dFdx branch and
*always* 3-points (`gfx_webgpu_shader.c:349`). This is the exact source of the documented
~5/px WebGPU↔GL establishing-shot "filter noise." Note WebGPU is the **more** faithful
side (real RDP 3-points in both mag and min); the GL/Metal nearest-snap under
magnification is itself a deviation (FILT-2). **Fix:** converge the three — either port
the footprint gate into WGSL (needs a filter-scale uniform WebGPU doesn't yet ship) or
drop the nearest path from GL/Metal (cleaner for fidelity, slightly costlier). Risk
medium/low respectively. *The 3-point math itself is verified byte-identical and
correct across all three backends + a CPU reference (see §E).*

## C. Room admission / DAM-R2

### R-01 — DAM-R2: distant reservoir shore not admitted from the establishing cam — P2, **LANDED 2026-07-19 (Dam-scoped)**

> **Current state (2026-07-20).** This section is four superseding rounds deep
> (2026-07-19 fix → Task 5 FOV adjudication → Task 5b capture-aspect correction →
> review-round-2 attribution wording); read the archaeology below only if you need the
> derivation. The three settled conclusions are:
> 1. **FOV is retail-faithful** — `Video.CutsceneFovY = 60` matches the asm (no FOV
>    field in `SetupIntroCamera`) and the re-registered geometry (`sy = sx = 1.000`),
>    to **60.0° ± 0.25°**.
> 2. **The "cinematic band" divergence is a capture artifact**, not rendered — the
>    fixed-640×480 screenshot canvas letterboxes the default 16:9 window; a 4:3 window
>    reproduces stock's 20/20 px band exactly (FID-0135).
> 3. **A small residual remains, now suspected over- (not under-) admission** — at
>    x≈430/540 native draws far shore/bridge geometry stock omits, the opposite
>    direction from R-01's original under-admission premise (FID-0137, R-02 deferred).

**Resolution (2026-07-19):** stock draws the shore (Task 0 ground truth). The suspected
intro-camera *pitch divergence* was a MISDIAGNOSIS: force-admitting the classifier's
frustum-visible far rooms at the as-is native camera renders the reservoir/shore/mountains
at the stock location — the camera AIM admits the rooms (not a pitch defect); the missing
far geometry left sky-clear color that read as a wrong pitch. The far rooms have NO portal
across the open-water gap (R-03), so no portal-gated widener can reach them. Fixed by
admitting every frustum-visible, loaded, not-yet-rendered room into the **draw-only** set
during `playerHasFrozenIntroCamera` only, via the T13b reproduce-then-restore idiom
(sim-neutral: `room_rendered` restored, draw list carries the vista). Opt-out
`GE007_NO_INTRO_FARVISTA_ADMIT` reproduces the bare-sky baseline byte-identically. ROI
[80,95,480,80] WebGPU luma 91→62, blue-dom 1.00→0.86 — a valid **native-vs-native**
before/after (same capture aspect both sides, common-mode, unaffected by FID-0135); GL
agrees. **[Review round 2, 2026-07-20]** The `(toward stock ~44/0.74)` clause in that same
sentence is a *stock*-comparison number taken at the unregistered default 16:9 window —
it is **superseded** by the registered re-measurement below: native luma 53.1 at a 4:3
window vs stock-ares 41.0, blue-dom 0.493 vs 0.465 (FID-0136, Task 5b). A residual intro
**FOV/framing** gap vs stock remains OPEN and is a *separate finding, NOT DAM-R2*: native
shows more dam-wall foreground and the mountains sit lower/smaller than stock at the same
byte-identical logged camera **(caveat, review round 2: this sentence's underlying capture
was also unregistered 16:9-vs-4:3; per Task 5b below, most of this "more foreground /
lower mountains" reading is the FID-0135 capture squeeze, not rendered geometry — see the
re-registered geometry, whose small residual is now attributed to admission, not
projection)**; native intro uses `Video.CutsceneFovY`=60, not `Video.FovY` (Task 0's FovY
override didn't change the intro framing).

**FOV ADJUDICATED — Task 5 (2026-07-20): CutsceneFovY = 60 is retail-FAITHFUL; the
framing residual is NOT an FOV defect.** **[Corrected, review round 2]** It is **not**
simply "the DAM-R2 admission superset" — per Task 5b's re-registered geometry (below),
most of the originally-reported framing residual was the FID-0135 capture-aspect
confound, not admission at all. The small true residual is DAM-R2 admitting a
**different** far-room set than retail's authored PVS: native replaces retail's authored
per-room PVS with a structurally different portal-BFS + heuristic-widener mechanism (plus
the Dam-scoped frustum force-admit), and the decompiled PVS consumer separately carries a
known **under**-admission bug (FID-0121) — so native may admit the **wrong** rooms in
either direction (→ R-02). The newly-visible far shore/bridge geometry at the registered
landmarks (x≈430/540, see below) shows this cuts the *other* way too: native draws
geometry stock does not, an **over-admission** risk not covered by DAM-R2's original
under-admission premise, tracked separately as **FID-0137** (→ R-02).
Two independent legs agree the intro renders at FOV_y = 60 and native already uses it, so
no FOV code change is warranted:
- **Asm leg**: retail's authored intro camera struct `struct SetupIntroCamera`
  (`bondtypes.h:3872`) carries only pos/yaw/pitch/pad/lang — **no FOV field**. Retail
  renders the intro through `lvlRender` → `viSetFovY(g_CurrentPlayer->fovy)` with the
  player base `fovy = 60.0` (`player_2.c:479`); no non-60 `fovy` write exists on the
  frozen-intro path. Vertical framing depends **only** on `perspfovy` — `c_scaley` in
  `currentPlayerSetCameraScale` (`bondview.c:1801`) is a function of `perspfovy` alone;
  aspect enters `c_scalex` (`:1802`) only, i.e. horizontal. Port `Video.CutsceneFovY`
  default 60 (`platform_sdl.c:461`) exactly reproduces this.
- **Native leg (trace)**: at the registered idx5/pad-273 intro the engine renders
  `vi_fovy = 60.0, aspect = 1.4545 (= 320/220 viewport)` on **both** WebGPU and GL
  (`GE007_TRACE_FOV`) — native provably already uses the retail value.
- **Geometric leg — SUPERSEDED by Task 5b (2026-07-20), see the correction block below.**
  The original leg compared a native capture taken at the default **16:9** window against
  the 4:3 stock frame *without registering them*; the two canvases differ by a 0.75×
  vertical scale and a 60 px offset, so every landmark Δ it reported (including the
  "~50 px mountain silhouette" and the "centre column x≈270", which is wrong on a
  640-wide canvas — the centre is 320) is invalid as stated. Its **conclusion** (FOV_y =
  60) survives and is now *better* supported: on properly registered frames the fit is the
  identity. Corrected numbers below.

**CORRECTION — Task 5b (2026-07-20): the intro "cinematic band" divergence is a CAPTURE
artifact, and the re-registered geometry re-confirms FOV_y = 60.**

*Band mechanism (adjudicated).* There is **no cutscene-specific letterbox** in either
retail or the port. GoldenEye's single-player viewport is permanently 320×220 at
`uly = 10` — `bondviewGetCurrentPlayerViewportHeight` (retail `0x7F086D24`,
`bondview.c:15600`) returns `VIEWPORT_HEIGHT_DEFAULT` = 220 (`fr.h:33`) and
`bondviewGetCurrentPlayerViewportUly` (retail `0x7F086E38`, `bondview.c:15646`) returns
`VIEWPORT_ULY_DEFAULT` = 10 (`fr.h:80`) on the non-`cameraBufferToggle`, 1-player path
taken by both gameplay and the frozen intro. So retail's band is 10/240 top and bottom =
**20/20 px** on a 640×480 4:3 output, which is exactly what the stock-ares frame measures.
The port reproduces it *proportionally*: `gfx_calc_and_set_viewport`
(`gfx_pc.c:21058`) scales the N64 viewport rect by `ratio_x = window_w/320`,
`ratio_y = window_h/240` (`gfx_pc.c:207-220`), leaving the band as the cleared frame.
(Adjudicated against the stock-ares *output* + the decompiled constants; no MIPS
disassembler is available in this environment, so the constants were not re-read from the
ROM — the hardware capture is the stronger ground truth for an observable band height.)

*Therefore the reported "native 75 px vs retail 20 px band" is not rendered.* The
screenshot path resamples the drawable into a fixed 640×480 canvas with aspect
preservation (`platform_sdl.c:737`, `SCREENSHOT_W/H`); at the shipped default window
1440×810 (16:9, `platform_sdl.c:2036`) it **adds** (480 − 640/(16/9))/2 = 60 px of bar and
squeezes the scene to 360 rows, inside which the engine's genuine 10/240 band is 15 px —
60 + 15 = **75**, the measured value. Re-capturing the same build at a 4:3 window
(`GE007_WINDOW_WIDTH=1440 GE007_WINDOW_HEIGHT=1080`) yields **20/20**, matching stock
exactly, on **WebGPU and GL**, and in **gameplay** as well as the intro (so it is not
cutscene-scoped). Tracked as **FID-0135**; disclosure landed in `a3acb93`. No render
change was made or warranted.

*Re-registered geometry (replaces the Task-5 geometric leg).* With the 4:3 native capture,
a gradient-correlation fit of stock→native over the whole 640×480 canvas returns the
**identity**: `sy = 1.000, sx = 1.000, ty = tx = 0`, correlation 0.683. The same fit
against the old 16:9 capture returns `sy = 0.75` (corr 0.417) — i.e. the prior comparison
carried an unregistered 25 % vertical size difference, which by itself produces the
"mountains smaller and lower, more foreground" reading. Since a pure FOV change is exactly
a crop-scale about the image centre, `sy = 1.000` means native's vertical FOV equals
stock's; the sy window within Δcorr ≤ 0.01 is [0.995, 1.005] → **stock FOV_y = 60.0
± 0.25°** (vs the old ±4°). Landmark mean |Δy| across 10 detections (sky/mountain
silhouette and the water→dam/rock transition at x = 140/240/320/430/540) improves
**57.7 px → 22.5 px**; whole-content mean-abs-diff **33.27 → 21.23**. The residual
landmark deltas are concentrated on the right half (x = 430/540), where native draws far
shore/bridge geometry that stock does not — consistent with the R-02 admission difference
below, not with projection. **[Review round 2, 2026-07-20]** This is the *opposite*
direction from DAM-R2's original under-admission premise — the far shore/bridge geometry
at x≈430/540 is native drawing **more** than stock, not less — and was invisible behind
the 16:9/4:3 capture squeeze until this registration. Filed as **FID-0137** (over-admission
risk; see R-02 below).

*Attribution wording (review finding).* Calling native's admission a "frustum **superset**"
is too narrow. Native does not merely draw *extra* rooms: per R-02 below it uses a
structurally **different** mechanism (portal-BFS + heuristic wideners, plus the Dam-scoped
frustum force-admit) in place of retail's authored per-room PVS, and the decompiled PVS
consumer also carries a known **under**-admission bug (FID-0121). Native may therefore
admit the **wrong** far rooms — some retail draws and native omits, some native draws and
retail omits — not a strict superset. The residual framing/silhouette differences should be
read that way.

*ROI re-filing (review finding).* The shore-ROI brightness observation is a **native-vs-
hardware** finding and was mis-filed under DAM-R1, whose scope in this document is
**web-vs-native** backend divergence (R1a refuted, R1b refuted/closed for native, R1c a
WGSL port gap). It now has its own record, **FID-0136**. Corrected, registered numbers at
ROI [80,95,480,80]: stock-ares luma 41.0 / B-dominance 0.465 (B/max(R,G) 1.473); native
4:3 luma 53.1 / 0.493 (1.582). The old "native 62" was measured at the unregistered 16:9
canvas, i.e. over different scene content; the gap is real but smaller than reported.

**Scope (review finding, this round):** over-admission safety was validated on Dam only
(plus Silo, which pins the opt-out ON in `tools/silo_intro_aperture_regression.sh` rather
than being validated). Per repo doctrine, an unvalidated-vs-stock change must not ship on
levels it hasn't been checked against, so the fix is gated to
`g_CurrentStageToLoad == LEVELID_DAM` in `bg.c` — it no longer fires on any other level's
frozen intro. Other levels' frozen intros (Facility, Silo, Frigate, etc.) are candidates
for the same admission pass pending their own stock-ares over-admission adjudication; this
R-01 entry is the doc-of-record for that follow-up. Original CONFIRMED analysis below.


Reproduced: `GE007_INTRO_CAMERA_INDEX=4` resolves to room 71; the shore-bearing far
rooms classify `class=far adj_rendered=-1` — frustum-visible but **not portal-adjacent**
to any rendered room. Every port widener (edge-rescue, visibility-supplement, camera-seed
multi-hop) is portal-adjacency-gated, so none can cross the open-water gap;
`GE007_CAMERA_SEED_WALK_HOPS=16` raised the draw-only set 10→39 (more *near* geometry)
but the shore stayed absent. The geometry renders fine from the gameplay walkway because
it *is* portal-reachable there. Classifier logic `bg.c:16894`. **Fix:** admit authored
far-vista rooms via the sim-neutral `g_BgRoomDrawOnly` set — best by wiring R-02.
**Risk medium** (shared machinery; re-run intro oracles on every level).

### R-02 — authored global visibility list (opcode-100 PVS) parsed but never consumed ← likely root cause — P2, PROBABLE
Retail admits exactly these far rooms via per-room PVS lists. The port **fixes up** the
opcode-100 table (`bg.c:5330`) but its consumer `sub_GAME_7F0B38B4` (`bg.c:3456`) has
**no live caller** (grep: only the definition + LEFTOVERDEBUG asm) — the port replaced
authored PVS with portal-BFS + heuristic wideners, which structurally cannot reach `far`
rooms. The C body also carries **FID-0121** (processes the first vis-string from the
matched byte position rather than resetting to pair-start), so it would under-admit even
if wired. **Fix:** drive `sub_GAME_7F0B38B4` (FID-0121-corrected) over the camera/current
room and feed admits into `g_BgRoomDrawOnly` (NOT `room_rendered` — retail feeds
`room_rendered`, which perturbs RNG; the port must stay draw-only). **Risk medium-high**
(new admission source; validate no over-admission of the train-sky-leak / room-14 far-
shard class — see also **FID-0137**, the registered-capture evidence that the *current*
Dam-scoped frustum force-admit already over-admits far shore/bridge geometry at x≈430/540
relative to stock, the opposite direction from this section's under-admission premise).
**Stock-N64 capture at `INTRO_CAMERA_INDEX=4` required before shipping.**

### R-03/04/05 (supporting) — CONFIRMED / HYPOTHESIS
- **R-03:** the visibility-supplement adjacency gate (`bg.c:2241`) makes `far` rooms
  permanently unreachable — deliberate (removing it reintroduced room-14 far-valley
  shards). Correct answer is R-02, not loosening the gate.
- **R-04:** `GE007_CAMERA_SEED_WALK_HOPS` can't admit far rooms (per R-03) and over-admits
  at high counts — leave default 0; not the DAM-R2 lever.
- **R-05:** the far-plane cap `maxZ = zrange[1]/mCurrentLevelVisibilityScale` (`bg.c:7443`)
  is a hard N64 draw-distance cap but **not** the DAM-R2 blocker (shore rooms pass the
  frustum). Sim-visible; any release must be draw-only. Stock-verdict-pending.
- **Negative results (CLEAN):** no admission hysteresis/flicker (draw-only set stable
  every frame); no stale room state across the camera cut.

## D. Latent / defensive items

- **PVD-001 — WebGPU depth-clip fallback incomplete — Medium, PROBABLE (web latent).**
  `gfx_init` forces `g_depth_clamp_enabled = true` for WebGPU (`gfx_pc.c:25082`), so the
  CPU clipper omits depth-plane clipping and relies on the GPU to *clamp*. But when the
  adapter lacks `DepthClipControl`, pipelines are built `unclippedDepth = FALSE`
  (`gfx_webgpu.c:708`) and the GPU *clips* instead — with no compensating path (WGSL
  doesn't apply GL's `z*=0.3` squash). **Native M3 Max grants the feature (capture logged
  the "lacks" warning 0 times; Dam far cliff intact), so this is latent, not live.**
  **Fix:** on the featureless branch, route near/far-crossing tris through the CPU
  clipper (make `needs_view_clip` include `needs_depth_clip` when the GPU can't clamp) —
  smaller and hash-neutral than lowering the global. Risk low-med.
- **EN-1 — `gfx_resolve_addr` segment-first ordering — P3, HYPOTHESIS (web latent).**
  `gfx_ptr.h:226` resolves a segment nibble before the registry (no host-pool guard) —
  the inverse of the ILP32-hardened `seg_addr` (`68afbc6`). No live trigger: the N64-interp
  call sites feed genuine big-endian segment tokens; the texture site checks the registry
  first; the one host-pointer site is diagnostic-only. **Fix (defensive):** mirror
  `seg_addr`'s registry→host-pool→segment order on ILP32, width-guarded. Risk very low.
- **TMEM-4 — runtime `G_LOADTLUT` source over-read — P2, PROBABLE.** The runtime branch
  (`gfx_pc.c:21740`) clamps `count` only to `256 - palofs`, never bounding `base+count`
  to the source image, so non-zero `uls/ult` or an undersized source over-reads (≤512 B,
  rare). Sibling of the confetti class (`48d835d`), on the palette source. **Fix:** mirror
  the static branch's source-extent clamp. Risk low.
- **TMEM-3 — static CI format-recovery vs stale TLUT — P2, CONFIRMED (self-flagged).**
  The `import_texture` recovery block (`gfx_pc.c:15852`) can decode a recovered CI format
  against `rdp.palette_addrs` from a *separate* G_LOADTLUT — the in-code comment warns of
  it. **Fix:** re-fetch via `texGetPalette` when the recovered fmt is CI. Risk low.
- **FMA-1 — cull cross-product dead-band gap — P2, CONFIRMED(mech).** The backface-cull
  sign test (`gfx_pc.c:19514`) is a contractible `dx1*dy2 - dy1*dx2`; the existing
  `|cross|<0.03` dead-band (`:19519`) covers only CPU-clipped room tris, leaving
  guard/prop/weapon geometry to flip culled↔drawn web-vs-native at grazing angles
  (transient slivers). **Fix:** extend the dead-band to all tris, or compute in double,
  or compile `gfx_pc.c` `-ffp-contract=off`. Risk low.
- **FMA-2 — XLU sort epsilon below ULP — P2, PROBABLE (strongest persistent web-vs-native
  candidate).** The room-XLU sort key is mean vertex `w` (500–10000 units); the comparators
  use an **absolute** `epsilon = 0.0001f` (`gfx_pc.c:14235`, `:14359`, **verified**). Float
  ULP at `w=2048` is ~2.4e-4 > epsilon, so beyond depth ~1000 two exactly-equal-depth
  groups (coplanar glass, split water) can differ by 1–4 ULP from transform contraction,
  exceeding epsilon on one target but not the other → **persistent** blend-order flip
  web vs native. **Fix:** relative epsilon `fmaxf(1e-4, 4e-7·max|key|)` or quantize keys
  before comparing. Risk low.
- **PVD-002 — Metal ZMODE_DEC decal bias magnitude — Low, CONFIRMED.** Metal's
  `-7.5e-6` constant (`gfx_metal.mm:3502`, Depth32Float) is ~15× GL/WebGPU's `-2·r`,
  over-biasing coplanar decals. GL≡WebGPU. **Fix:** recompute for Depth32Float
  (`-2 units ≈ -4.8e-6`) or normalize to slope-only. Risk low (macOS non-default backend).

## E. Verified-CLEAN areas (with evidence)

The great majority of the stack is correct — recording it prevents re-hunting.

**Projection / depth.** The `[-w,+w] → [0,+w]` half-Z remap is a single site
(`gfx_pc.c:20205`) correctly paired with each backend's clip convention (GL keeps
`[-w,w]`; Metal/WebGPU `[0,w]`) — no half-Z error. Viewport/scissor is computed once as
float and truncated to int32 **before** backend dispatch, so all three receive identical
rects (A/B shift-correlation: unique `dx=0,dy=0` minimum). `wgpu_clamp_rect` odd-size
logic is correct. PerspNorm (`G_MW_PERSPNORM`) is intentionally a no-op for a float host
T&L; retail perspnorm is still computed game-side; no w under/overflow at Dam scale
(guarded `fabsf(w)<1e-4`). Near-plane epsilon is near-only (avoids cracks). Far geometry
is submitted+clamped (faithful, not vanished).

**Endianness / pointer-width.** ROM/DL decode uses a correct dual-interpreter split
(host-endian `Gwords` for PC DLs, `read_be32` for ROM DLs) — no path byteswaps
host-built words. G_VTX/G_MTX N64 decode assemble big-endian byte-wise. All texel
decoders (RGBA16/32, IA/I, CI) either `memcpy` host-order statics or explicitly unpack
big-endian ROM data; palette entries are unpacked from a `uint16_t` value
(endian-independent) and G_LOADTLUT byteswaps ROM palettes once at load. The `gfx_ptr`
registry (65536 slots, open-addressed, per-stage clear) covers every dyn-pool/segment
pointer; the confetti over-read class (`48d835d`) is structurally closed
(decode-footprint plausibility backstop). No new unregistered pointer-bearing structure
entered the RDP token path this week.

**This week's perf work — all CLEAN (independently audited):**
- **PERF-013** (combiner hash index, `8328836`): **collision-safe.** The hash mixes both
  identity fields (`cc_id` u64, `cc_options` u32) but is only a probe-position hint; the
  match is a **full-key compare on both fields** (`gfx_pc.c:14981`), and every other
  combiner field is a pure function of that pair — a hash collision costs an extra probe,
  never a wrong combiner. Table load-factor ≤0.5 (always terminates); null-index falls
  back to linear scan. Byte-behavior-identical to the prior scan.
- **PERF-014** (SetPipeline/SetBindGroup dedup, `4765099`): **no ABA / safe.** The
  trackers are pass-scoped (reset to NULL at every `s_pass` begin) and only compare a
  handle that is still alive and bound (the render-pass encoder retains resources until
  submit on both Dawn and wgpu-native), so a recycled address always passes through a
  fresh `SetBindGroup`. Distinct from the WEB-068 ABA, which bit a *persistent* cache.
  The modern-mesh interleave correctly forces re-bind (`s_bg_applied = NULL`).
- **PERF-015/016** (`730a218`): store float offsets into a movable arena, materialize the
  pointer only post-growth — pointer-width clean. PERF-008/014 aren't token-bearing.

**Materials.** The N64 3-point filter math is byte-identical and correct across GLSL,
WGSL, MSL, and a CPU reference (canonical triangle filter, correct diagonal split and
texel-center convention); the host sampler is forced to NEAREST when the shader 3-point
is active (no double-filter). HW blend factors match GL exactly across backends
(ALPHA→(SRC_ALPHA,1−SRC_ALPHA), MODULATE→(DST,ZERO)); fog is a per-vertex attribute mixed
identically in all three fragment shaders (fog is **not** a cross-backend blend
divergence). The texture-edge cutout threshold (0.19, force-opaque) is identical across
backends. Palette/CI cache keying includes palette addr, bank, and LUT mode (no
aliasing); IA16-vs-RGBA16 TLUT decode is correct and ROM-free-tested. Output Bayer dither
(anti-banding) is consistent and opt-in across backends. Cross-draw memory-blend
snapshot stacking is correct on all three (intra-*batch* overlap is a shared limitation,
GL alone offering a `pertri` A/B).

**Lower-severity / by-design (not defects):** AC-2 (0.19 constant is tuned, consistent),
AC-4 (RGB dither deliberately post-FX only), AC-5 (GL A2C path dormant for GE content),
BLEND-2 (no A2C under MSAA — WebGPU is single-sample anyway), BLEND-3 (coarse blender-mode
mapping is intentional), BLEND-4 (per-batch snapshot granularity, shared), FILT-3/4/5
(2D/HUD not 3-pointed; clamp-edge tap wrap — all backends equally), TMEM-5 (heuristic
per-triangle LOD), FMA-3/4 (shard/frustum thresholds — bounded ±1-frame), PVD-003 (depth
format precision asymmetry).

**Partial (session-interrupted, follow-up):** the struct-layout/bitfield ILP32 sub-lane
returned a promising-CLEAN anchor (the `Gfx` command sub-unions are correctly gated
`#if IS_BIG_ENDIAN && !IS_64_BIT`; `Vtx` is force-aligned) but did not finish its full
sweep. Recommend a short follow-up.

## F. Beyond-1:1 constraint-release catalog (ranked by win-per-risk)

All proposals are **draw-only** and fit the existing `GE007_*` / `Video.*` flag
architecture (faithful preset stays byte-faithful; identity at the default value).

> **Two hard seams to never cross** (both break faithfulness/sim gates):
> (1) `g_ViBackData->zfar` / `g_ScaledFarFogIntensity` are **shared with AI sight**
> (`fog.c:756`) — the far plane and AI range are the *same number*; always use a
> render-local copy or the cosmetic `Video.FogDensity` multiplier (which the port already
> correctly decouples). (2) Room-admission and model-LOD changes must pass the
> `sim_state_hash` invariance gate because of the `room_rendered`→auto-aim coupling
> (`chr.c ~5205`).

| id | release | win at Dam | risk | effort |
|----|---------|-----------|------|--------|
| **R1** ★ | Honest horizon — remaster-default `Video.FogDensity ≈ 0.55–0.7` outdoors (mechanism already merged, cosmetic-only, proven decoupled from AI) | fog wall recedes; reservoir reads as real distance | very low | **S** |
| **R3** | `Video.Anisotropy` (+ optional mip for ROOM textures) in sampler creation | ground/cliff stop shimmering | low | S–M |
| **R5** | `Video.SmoothSky` — skip the `Sky.{R,G,B} &= 0xf8` 5-bit mask (`fog.c:690`), let output dither finish | banded blue sky → smooth gradient | low | **S** |
| **R2** | Extended draw distance via the existing draw-only supplement (bump `GE007_VIS_SUPPLEMENT_MAX_EXTRA` 12→24) — the DAM-R2 lever | recovers distant reservoir geometry | low-med | S–M |
| **R8** | Prop distance-fog cull softening (rides R1's lower density; `fogGetPropDistColor` is render-only) | distant props fade in, not pop | low | S |
| **R10** | `Video.NoiseDitherScale` — attenuate alpha-noise grain at high RenderScale | cleaner fades at 2×+ | low | S |
| **R4** | Extend HD-pack coverage to hash-keyed dynamic/sky/effect textures (scoped P2.1) | sharp sky + muzzle/smoke | med | M |
| **R7** | `Video.RenderFarScale` — multiply *only* the render-local `far` in `guPerspectiveF` (never the shared zfar) | modest at Dam, large on long-sightline stages | low-med | M |
| **R6** | `Video.LodDistanceScale` → `g_ModelDistanceScale <1` to hold detailed meshes farther | props keep silhouettes, no LOD pop | med (needs invariance gate) | M |
| **R9** | Bypass the projection-matrix `F2L→L2F` fixed-point round-trip (float matrix already captured) | steadier far edges at 2×+ SSAA | low-med | M |

**Ship-first trio (all Small, all provably draw-only, all fix visible baseline
artifacts):** R1, R3, R5.

## G. Recommended sequencing

1. **DAM-R1b (sRGB scene-target)** — the flagship user-visible web defect; well-scoped,
   native-safe, and pairs with the already-landed PERF-005b to clear the Dam-startup
   visuals. Do the promotion capture first.
2. **TMEM-2 then TMEM-1** — the monitor-text reinterpretation class; TMEM-2 (cache key)
   unblocks TMEM-1. Highest-value *faithfulness* fix; all backends.
3. **AC-3 + DAM-R1c (WGSL `opt_noise` / suppress)** — cheap, additive, closes two WebGPU
   parity gaps in one shader edit.
4. **BLEND-1 (coverage-alpha writeMask)** — medium risk (PSO variant); A/B glass/water on
   all backends.
5. **R-02 (authored PVS) → R-01 (DAM-R2)** — gated on a **stock-ares capture** at
   `INTRO_CAMERA_INDEX=4` to confirm retail draws the shore. This is the one item that
   must not proceed without a hardware reference.
6. **Latent hardening** (PVD-001 fallback, TMEM-3/4 clamps, EN-1 ordering, FMA-1/2
   epsilons) — batch as defensive fixes; each is small and low-risk.
7. **Beyond-1:1 R1/R3/R5** — the visible remaster wins.

**The one blocking dependency for the whole program:** a stock-N64 (ares) Dam capture
set — establishing camera, intro swirl, and the reservoir walkway — to adjudicate every
`stock-verdict-pending` item (DAM-R2, DAM-R3, R-05, the far-plane caps). The ares binary
exists at `build/ares-movement-oracle/…/ares.app`; run it **alone** (tape/oracle gates
false-fail under capture contention). Until then, DAM-R2-class changes are proposals, not
committed fixes.
